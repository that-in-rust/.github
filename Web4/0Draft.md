Mind Map [29th July 2025]

- A whole new web browser, frontend development framework, backend development framework for Rails and React like developer experience, Near-native speed, Freedom from Legacy technology burden.

Core Philosophy :-

- Opiniated
- One way to do things
- Clarity over verbose avoidance

- Promises :-

- Core

  - Faster Development
  - Better Developer Experience
  - Less-error prone code
  - Runtime Reliability

- Simplified Rust

  - Simplify Ownership and Borrowing System for people coming from different ecosystem
  - Avoid cognitive load of Lifetimes, Rust AST, Macros, Codegen
  - Easy debugging

- Frontend Library
  - Compile Time Optimisation
  - Bloat free Bundle Size
  - Tiny WASM outputs: ~50-200KB vs 2-5MB for React/Vue bundles
  - Attack surface reduction
  - Type Safety
  - No browser differences
  - Development Speed
  - Cost Saving

ðŸ“Š Quantitative Comparisons
| Metric | Current JS/CSS | Marauder UI | Improvement |
|--------|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| Bundle Size | 2-5MB | 50-200KB | 90-95% smaller |
| Startup Time | 100-500ms | 10-50ms | 80-90% faster |
| Memory Usage | 50-200MB | 10-50MB | 70-80% less |
| Type Safety | Runtime checks | Compile-time | 100% prevention |
| Security Vulnerabilities | High (XSS, injection) | Minimal | 90% reduction |

## **Avengers Assemble Shortcut: `d202409()`**

This function performs a comprehensive Rust project management operation with Avengers-themed messages:

### **What it does:**

1. **Finds all Rust projects** (Cargo.toml files) in your git repository
2. **Builds each project** with `cargo build`
3. **Cleans each project** with `cargo clean`
4. **Commits all changes** with an "Avengers Assemble!" message
5. **Pushes to remote** repository

### **Usage:**

```bash
d202409
```

### **The function includes:**

- **Avengers-themed progress messages** (Iron Man, Thor, Hawkeye, etc.)
- **Error handling** with themed error messages
- **Summary report** of all build/clean operations
- **Automatic git operations** (add, commit, push)

### **To add this to your `.zshrc`:**

You can copy this function from `zzUnclassified/alias_d202409_20250418.txt` to your `.zshrc` file, or source the file directly in your `.zshrc`:

```bash
<code_block_to_apply_changes_from>
```

The function is quite comprehensive and would be perfect for managing multi-project Rust repositories with a fun Avengers theme!
