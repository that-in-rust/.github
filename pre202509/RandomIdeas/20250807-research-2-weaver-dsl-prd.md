Of course. Here is a detailed technical Product Requirements Document (PRD) for the Weaver engine, structured in the same comprehensive format as the Axiom PRD.

## **Product Requirements Document: Weaver Engine v1.0**

- **Product:** Weaver Rendering Engine & Axiom Integration
- **Version:** 1.0
- **Status:** Inception
- **Last Updated:** August 7, 2025
- **Author:** [Your Name/Team]

### **1. Overview**

**Weaver** is a high-performance, DOM-less rendering engine for building complex, application-like user interfaces on the web. It is designed to solve the performance bottlenecks inherent in the browser's DOM, such as layout, reflow, and repaint cycles.

The engine leverages the core logic of the **Axiom DSL** for verifiable correctness but directs its output to a hardware-accelerated `<canvas>` element instead of the DOM. To maintain backward compatibility with essential web technologies, Weaver uses a novel hybrid architecture: it "weaves" together the raw performance of a canvas renderer with the power of the browser's native CSS and accessibility engines running in a headless mode.

The purpose is to empower developers to build a new class of web applications that demand desktop-grade performance and graphical fidelity, without sacrificing declarative principles or essential user-facing features like accessibility and text interaction.

### **2. Goals and Objectives**

| Goal                      | Objective                                                               | Success Metric                                                                                                          |
| :------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Rendering Performance** | Deliver fluid, 60 FPS experiences for graphically intensive UIs.        | Maintain a consistent >58 FPS during benchmark animations and state changes on a target mid-range device.               |
| **Rendering Consistency** | Achieve pixel-perfect rendering consistency across all modern browsers. | Pass a visual regression test suite with a >99.9% similarity threshold between Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.             |
| **Accessibility**         | Ensure applications built with Weaver are fully accessible.             | All standard library components must pass WCAG 2.1 AA standards using automated checkers (e.g., Axe) and manual audits. |
| **Bundle Size**           | Keep the engine's footprint manageable despite its power.               | The core Weaver runtime (Wasm renderer + JS glue) must be under **150kB** gzipped.                                      |
| **Developer Experience**  | Abstract away the complexity of canvas rendering.                       | Developers must be able to build complex components without writing any direct canvas API calls.                        |

### **4. Functional Requirements**

#### **4.1. Logic Core (Axiom)**

- The system must use the Axiom DSL for defining UI structure and state logic.
- The Axiom engine must compile rules and facts into an in-memory **Render Graph**, a platform-agnostic representation of the UI.

#### **4.2. Layout & Style Engine**

- The engine must maintain an **off-screen DOM tree** that is not visible to the user.
- It must support a well-defined subset of CSS for layout and styling (including Flexbox, Grid, colors, fonts, borders).
- It must use the browser's `getComputedStyle()` API on the off-screen tree to calculate final styles.

#### **4.3. Canvas Renderer**

- The renderer must efficiently draw the Render Graph to a single `<canvas>` element.
- It must support rendering basic primitives (rectangles, circles, paths), images, and gradients.
- It must implement optimizations such as draw-call batching and dirty-rectangle repainting.

#### **4.4. Accessibility & Text Engine**

- The engine must generate and maintain a non-visible **Accessibility Tree** in the live DOM, perfectly synced with the canvas visuals.
- This tree must use standard ARIA roles and attributes (`role`, `aria-label`, etc.).
- The engine must render text using overlaid, transparent DOM elements to ensure native text quality, selection, and copy-paste functionality.

#### **4.5. Event System**

- The engine must capture user input events (e.g., `click`, `mousemove`, `keydown`) on the canvas element.
- It must perform efficient **Hit Testing** to determine which element in the Render Graph the user is interacting with.
- It must translate these low-level events into logical events for the Axiom engine.

---

### **5. Technical Requirements**

- **System Architecture:** The rendering and layout engine will be built in **Rust** and compiled to **WebAssembly (Wasm)**. A **JavaScript/TypeScript** layer will handle DOM interfacing (canvas context, accessibility tree, events).
- **Performance Requirements:**
  - **Frame Rate:** Maintain >58 FPS during continuous animations on a target device.
  - **Latency:** User input events must have a visual response in under **50ms**.
- **Scalability Needs:** The renderer must handle a scene with **10,000+** distinct, renderable objects without dropping below 30 FPS.
- **Security & Compliance:**
  - The engine must not introduce security vulnerabilities. All external data (e.g., image URLs) must be handled securely.
  - The project will be licensed under the **MIT License**.

---

### **6. Non-Functional Requirements**

- **Usability:** A custom developer tool is required that allows inspection of both the Render Graph and the Accessibility Tree simultaneously.
- **Accessibility (A11y):** The Weaver engine itself must enable the creation of WCAG 2.1 AA compliant applications. This is a primary, non-negotiable requirement.
- **Reliability:** The engine must be memory-safe and free of memory leaks. The renderer must be deterministic and produce identical output across browsers.
- **Maintainability:** The Rust and TypeScript codebases must have >90% test coverage, focusing on the rendering, layout, and accessibility synchronization logic.

---

### **7. Assumptions and Constraints**

- **Assumptions:**
  - Target users understand they are opting out of SEO and other document-centric web features.
  - Users are building applications, not content websites.
- **Constraints:**
  - The initial core team consists of [e.g., 8 engineers, 1 product manager, 1 UX designer].
  - The v1.0 release is targeted for a timeline of 24 months due to the complexity of the rendering engine.
  - The project budget is [e.g., $Y million].

### **9. Risks and Mitigation**

| Risk                                            | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy                                                                                                                                                           |
| :---------------------------------------------- | :--------- | :----- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Accessibility Tree Desynchronization**        | High       | High   | Dedicate significant engineering resources to building a robust, test-driven synchronization system. Conduct regular audits with third-party accessibility experts.           |
| **Debugging Complexity is Overwhelming**        | High       | High   | Prioritize the development of a multi-layer visual debugger from the beginning. It must be treated as a core feature, not an add-on.                                          |
| **Performance Overhead of the Hybrid Model**    | Medium     | High   | Develop a rigorous, continuous benchmarking suite to identify performance cliffs early. The suite must test scenarios with many small objects vs. few large, complex objects. |
| **Incomplete CSS Support Leads to Frustration** | Medium     | Medium | Clearly document the exact subset of CSS that is supported. Provide clear warnings or errors when unsupported properties are used.                                            |

### **12. Glossary**

- **Render Graph:** An in-memory, platform-agnostic tree of objects that describes what to draw on the screen.
- **Hit Testing:** The process of determining which visual object on the canvas a user's coordinates (e.g., from a click) intersect with.
- **Accessibility Tree:** A tree of UI elements, typically derived from the DOM, that is used by assistive technologies like screen readers.
- **Off-Screen DOM:** A set of DOM elements created in memory for calculation purposes (like styling) but never rendered to the screen.
- **Retained Mode Graphics:** A rendering approach where the application maintains a model (the Render Graph) of the scene to be rendered, as opposed to immediately drawing shapes (Immediate Mode).
