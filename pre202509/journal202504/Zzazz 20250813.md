Single Order
R1 - Dish 1
R2 - Dish 2
R3 - Dish 3


- For user this will a be a single order
- Single payment for all 3 orders
- Single delivery boy for all 3 orders together

=======
User Journey
- User comes and allowed to select N dishes x M unique restaurants (unique dishes x unique restaurants)
- They select different restaurants - communicate impact of far away places delivered together (final ETA)
    - Communicate inability to deliver
    - Communicate delay
- Give a grace order cancellation window for the customer
- Give a grace window for the restaurant to cancel the order

- Order O001
- Delivery Route D001 - Status share to customer Aggregate view
    - Legs 001 starts at the first restaurant which is decided basis a time optimized algorithm - Tuple of points A-B - Driver not reached
    - Legs 002 - B-C - Food is ready
    - Last leg ends at customer doorstep C-D
- Deliervery Route Initial
- Deliveery Route Actual
- Order feedback
    -  Restuarants as customers
    - Delivery boy as customers
    - Buying customers as customers

Problem 2 
3 features to delivery
1 FE 1BE

2 steps
- parametrization of each option you have
    - impact
    - rough ballpark estimate
    - complexity
    - risk to existing system or ecosystem
    - context of easy experiment
    - who is the pulling the weight
    - probability of success
- Draw 3 simulations
    - Stack rank the 3 simulations you ran of who will go first - and share the tradeoffs

Feature 1 - clear high probability of success
- 2 days to design
- BE 3 days
- FE 1 days

QA is 1 day for each

Feature 2 - 60% - experiment
- 1 day to design
- BE 2 days
- FE 2 days

Feature 3 - we decided it can be cool
- 1 day to design
- BE 1 day
- FE 1 day
