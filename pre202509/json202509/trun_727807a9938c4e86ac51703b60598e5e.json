  "input": "Of course. Crafting the right instructions for a Large Language Model is a bit like casting a precise spell. Based on your request to design a Harry Potter-themed coding workshop for a wide age range, focusing on a \"prompt -> code -> graph\" flow without any external files, here is a high-quality, text-only prompt designed to generate the curriculum you need.\n\n***\n\n### High-Quality LLM Prompt for a Harry Potter Coding Curriculum\n\n**Prompt:**\n\nAct as a world-class curriculum designer and a devoted Harry Potter scholar. Your mission is to create a complete, two-hour workshop curriculum titled \"Computational Charms: A Beginner's Guide to Python Spellcasting.\" This workshop is for a mixed-age group of students (ages 8-18) with zero prior programming experience.\n\nThe entire output must be a single, self-contained text document. You have **no access to external files, images, or notebooks**, so you must generate all necessary data and code snippets within your response.\n\nThe core pedagogical structure for each learning module must strictly follow this five-part sequence:\n1.  **The Narrative Hook:** An immersive, in-universe introduction to the lesson (e.g., \"Welcome to Potions class, today we will analyze ingredient potency...\").\n2.  **The Oracle's Prompt:** A high-quality, sample prompt that a student would give to an LLM (the \"Oracle\") to get the necessary data or code. Frame the LLM as a magical tool like the Pensieve or the Mirror of Erised.\n3.  **The Python Incantation:** The complete, runnable Python code required for the lesson. The code must be simple, well-commented, and directly related to the narrative.\n4.  **The Enchanted Visualization:** A detailed description of the visual output (the graph or drawing) that the code produces.\n5.  **The Mathematical Magic:** A simple, clear explanation of the core mathematical or logical concept being taught (e.g., \"This teaches us about coordinates (x,y)...\" or \"This shows a trend over time...\").\n\n**Curriculum Requirements:**\n\n1.  **Deep Thematic Integration:** Every element must be framed within the wizarding world. Python is \"spell-casting,\" code blocks are \"incantations,\" `import` statements are \"summoning charms,\" variables are \"magical ingredients,\" and the resulting graphs are \"prophecies\" or \"enchanted maps.\" This narrative framing is critical.[1]\n\n2.  **Progressive Difficulty & Visuals:** The workshop must start with simple, instant visual feedback and gradually introduce more abstract data concepts. Structure the curriculum into the following modules:\n    *   **Module 1: Charms 101 (Drawing with `turtle`):** Focus on basic geometry. The task is to draw a recognizable magical symbol, like the Deathly Hallows.[2] This provides immediate, satisfying visual results for the youngest students.[3]\n    *   **Module 2: Herbology Data (Bar Charts with `matplotlib`):** Introduce categorical data. The task is to create a bar chart classifying the number of magical plants in Professor Sprout's greenhouse by their use (e.g., Potion Ingredient, Defensive, Edible). Generate a simple dataset for this.\n    *   **Module 3: Divination & The House Cup (Line Graphs with `matplotlib`):** Introduce time-series data. The task is to plot the rise and fall of House Points for Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff, and Ravenclaw over a school term.[4] Generate a plausible dataset showing their fluctuating points over 6 months.\n    *   **Module 4 (Advanced Study): The Marauder's Map (Network Graphs with `networkx`):** This is an optional module for older students (14-18). The task is to visualize character relationships.[5, 6] Generate a simple list of character connections (e.g., ``) and use `networkx` to draw the social network.\n\n3.  **Enrichment & Extension:** Conclude the curriculum with a section called \"The Room of Requirement\" that includes:\n    *   **Gamification:** Suggest a House Point system for the workshop itself, awarding points for successful code execution (\"Spell cast perfectly!\"), debugging (\"Counter-jinx successful!\"), and creative customizations (changing colors, titles, etc.).\n    *   **Alternate Themes:** Briefly explain how this structure could be adapted for other popular universes (e.g., Marvel, Star Wars) to show the universality of the concepts.\n    *   **Next Steps:** Suggest a simple next step for curious students, like creating basic animations with `turtle` (e.g., a flying Golden Snitch).[7, 8]\n\nYour final output should be a beautifully formatted, easy-to-follow guide that an instructor could use to run the workshop directly.",

The workshop's purpose is to introduce the fundamentals of Python programming through a deeply immersive, Harry Potter-themed narrative. The core pedagogical structure for each learning module follows a consistent five-part sequence, often summarized as a 'prompt -> code -> graph' flow: 1) A Narrative Hook to engage students, 2) An Oracle's Prompt that students would use to query a Large Language Model, 3) The Python Incantation, which is the runnable code itself, 4) The Enchanted Visualization, a detailed textual description of the code's visual output, and 5) The Mathematical Magic, which explains the underlying computational concept. A critical constraint of the entire workshop is that it operates in a text-only environment, meaning it is delivered as a single, self-contained document with no access to external files, images, or interactive notebooks. Consequently, all 'graphs' or 'drawings' are not rendered visually but are instead described in rich, detailed text, challenging students to visualize the results based on the description.",

Because a full circle is 360 degrees, and for a shape with three equal sides (an equilateral triangle), you divide 360 by 3 to get 120 degrees for each external turn.

It crosses the horizontal axis 6 times and the vertical axis 4 times, corresponding to the 'a' and 'b' parameters, giving it a complex and magical appearance.",
        "mathematical_concepts": "This project is built on several mathematical concepts:\n- **Parametric Equations:** The curve is defined by x(t) and y(t), where 't' is the parameter.\n- **Trigonometry & Sinusoidal Functions:** The entire shape is generated by the interplay of two sine functions.\n- **Frequency and Amplitude:** The parameters A, B, a, and b directly control the width, height, and complexity (number of lobes) of the curve.\n- **Phase Shift:** The 'delta' parameter shifts one sine wave relative to the other, dramatically changing the shape of the curve."

      "differentiation_plan": "The differentiation plan provides scaffolding and challenges tailored to two primary age bands: 8-12 years and 13-18 years, ensuring all students are engaged and appropriately challenged.\n\n**Module 1: `turtle` Graphics**\n*   **Ages 8-12 (Scaffolding Focus):** Students receive the full, heavily commented code block. Their primary task is to run the code and then modify simple parameters like side length or color. The goal is to build confidence and understand direct cause-and-effect. A follow-up challenge might involve introducing a `for` loop with significant guidance.\n*   **Ages 13-18 (Problem-Solving Focus):** Students receive a code template with key commands or values missing. They are expected to deduce the correct commands (e.g., `forward`, `right`). They are immediately challenged to refactor the code using a `for` loop and then to independently create a different geometric shape (e.g., a triangle or a star), requiring them to calculate the correct angles.\n\n**Module 2: `matplotlib` Bar Charts**\n*   **Ages 8-12 (Data Manipulation Focus):** Students receive the full code. Their task is to modify the data within the existing lists (e.g., change population numbers) and add a new creature and its corresponding data point to the lists. The focus is on understanding the one-to-one relationship between items in paired lists.\n*   **Ages 13-18 (Data Structuring Focus):** Students receive a template and must define the data lists (`creatures`, `population`) themselves from a prose description. They are challenged to explore other chart types (`plt.plot` for a line chart) or research conceptual modifications, like changing bar colors or styles.\n\n**Module 3: `networkx` Network Graphs**\n*   **Ages 8-12 (Conceptual Focus):** Students receive the full code. Their task is to add one new character (node) and one new relationship (edge) to the existing graph. The focus is on the core metaphor: nodes are people, and edges are friendships.\n*   **Ages 13-18 (Abstraction Focus):** Students are given only the `import` statement and must build the entire graph from scratch using `G.add_node()` and `G.add_edge()`. They are challenged to model a different set of relationships from a story of their choice and to discuss the conceptual difference between an undirected graph (`nx.Graph`) for mutual friendships and a directed graph (`nx.DiGraph`) for asymmetrical relationships (e.g., parent-child).",
      "contingency_options": "This plan provides instructors with clear strategies to adapt the workshop's pacing in real-time.\n\n*   **If Time Runs Short:** The priority is to maintain a positive learning experience and achieve core objectives, not to finish every task. The instructor should proactively cut less critical features or simplify the final goal of an exercise. For example, instead of drawing a complex symbol with `turtle`, focus on perfectly drawing a simple square. Announce the change positively: 'We're going to focus our magic on mastering this one crucial spell perfectly.'\n\n*   **If Time Runs Long:** Use the extra time for enrichment and creative exploration. Offer optional extension challenges that were prepared in advance. Examples include: 'Challenge: Can your team figure out how to change the turtle's color or the chart's title?' or introduce a related 'unplugged' activity like 'Telephone Architects' with LEGOs to reinforce the concept of giving precise, sequential instructions.\n\n*   **If Students Struggle:** Implement a structured self-remediation process before intervening. Encourage pairs to: 1) Talk through the problem together. 2) Check their code for typos by comparing it to the instructor's example. 3) Ask a nearby pair for help. 4) Try a different approach. 5) If still stuck, use the red sticky note to signal for instructor help. This builds resilience and problem-solving skills.\n\n*   **If the Instructor's Demo Fails:** Model resilience and treat it as a learning opportunity. Announce cheerfully: 'Look at that, my spell has a bug! This is a perfect moment to practice our debugging charms. It happens to all programmers. Let's solve this together. Can anyone be my Navigator and spot the mistake?' This normalizes errors and demonstrates effective debugging strategies."

    "enchanted_visualization_guide": "### A Structured Method for Text-Only \"Enchanted Visualization\" Descriptions\n\nThis report outlines a structured methodology for creating comprehensive, accessible, and unambiguous text-only descriptions of visual outputs generated from Python code. This approach is designed for a pedagogical 'prompt -> code -> graph' flow where students do not have access to rendered images, files, or notebooks, ensuring they can reliably imagine or recreate the visuals from text alone.\n\n#### 1. Standardized Template for Describing Plots and Drawings\n\nBased on authoritative guidance from the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), a two-part text alternative is the standard for complex images like charts and graphs.\n\n**Part A: Short Description**\nA concise summary, often placed in an `alt` attribute, that identifies the image's content and purpose and indicates where the detailed description is located. A useful formula is: `\"[Chart type] of [type of data] where [reason for including chart].\"`\n*   **Example:** `\"Bar chart showing monthly and total visitors for the first quarter 2014 for sites 1 to 3. A detailed description follows this image.\"`\n\n**Part B: Long Description**\nA detailed textual representation of all essential information conveyed by the visualization. This should be available to all users, typically as text on the same page. The long description can be structured as paragraphs, lists, or tables and should include the following components:\n\n*   **Overview/Summary:** A high-level summary of the visualization's main takeaway, including key trends, patterns, and insights.\n*   **Dimensions & Layout:** Describe the overall layout, size, or extent of the visualization (e.g., \"a bar chart with 5 bars,\" \"a network graph arranged in a circular layout\").\n*   **Axes and Scales (for charts):** Explicitly state the labels for each axis (e.g., x-axis, y-axis), the units of measurement, and the range of values.\n*   **Elements and Their Properties:** Describe the individual components of the visualization (e.g., bars, lines, nodes, points) and their characteristics. This includes:\n    *   **Color:** Use clear, universally understood textual names for colors (e.g., 'bright red', 'deep blue', 'forest green').\n    *   **Shape/Pattern:** Describe any shapes, patterns, or textures used (e.g., 'a solid line', 'a dashed line', 'a bar with diagonal hatching').\n*   **Data and Values:** Provide the actual data points. For data-heavy visualizations, presenting this information in a structured HTML table is highly effective.\n*   **Trends and Relationships:** Describe the patterns and relationships between data points, such as increases, decreases, correlations, or clusters.\n*   **Coordinate References & Relative Positions:** Use clear spatial language (e.g., above, below, left of, right of, center) and cardinal directions (north, south, east, west) to describe the layout and relative placement of elements.\n*   **Ordering of Elements:** Describe the sequence or arrangement of visual elements, especially if it's meaningful (e.g., chronological order, ascending value).\n*   **Annotations:** Describe any text labels, legends, or callouts present in the visualization.\n\n#### 2. Examples for Specific Visualization Types\n\n**A. Turtle Graphics (`turtle` module)**\nDescriptions should narrate the turtle's actions and the resulting drawing sequentially.\n*   **Initial State:** Describe the turtle's starting conditions: position (typically center of canvas, 0,0), heading (typically East, 0 degrees), and pen state (down or up).\n*   **Sequence of Commands:** Detail the series of movements and actions. Describe `forward()` and `backward()` movements in units, `left()` and `right()` turns in degrees, and changes in pen state (`penup()`, `pendown()`), color (`color()`), and thickness (`pensize()`).\n*   **Resulting Shape:** Describe the final geometric shape or drawing created by the turtle's path. Use relative positions and directions to build a mental map.\n*   **Example:** `\"The turtle starts at the center of the canvas (0,0), facing East, with its pen down and set to a blue color. It moves forward 100 units, drawing a horizontal blue line. It then turns right 90 degrees to face South and moves forward 50 units, drawing a vertical blue line. This creates a blue 'L' shape. The turtle then lifts its pen, moves forward 20 units, puts its pen down, and draws a red circle with a radius of 10 units.\"`\n\n**B. Bar Chart (`matplotlib`)**\n*   **Description:** Detail the title, axes, and bars. Describe the x-axis categories and the y-axis values and units. For each bar, state its category, its exact height (value), and its visual properties (color, hatch pattern). Conclude by summarizing trends or comparisons.\n*   **Example:** `\"A bar chart titled 'Monthly Sales Performance'. The horizontal x-axis represents months: January, February, and March. The vertical y-axis represents sales in thousands of dollars, ranging from 0 to 100. The January bar is 'deep blue' and reaches a height of $45,000. The February bar is 'sky blue' and shows sales of $52,000. The March bar is 'forest green' with diagonal hatching and shows sales of $38,000. The chart shows that sales increased from January to February, then decreased in March.\"`\n\n**C. Line Chart (`matplotlib`)**\n*   **Description:** Detail the title, axes, and each line. Describe the x-axis (e.g., time) and y-axis (values, units). For each line, explain what it represents, its color, its style (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted), and any markers used (e.g., circles, squares). Trace the line's path, highlighting key points, peaks, and troughs.\n*   **Example:** `\"A line graph titled 'Temperature Fluctuations'. The x-axis shows time over 24 hours. The y-axis shows temperature in Celsius. A single 'bright red' solid line with small circular markers at each data point plots the temperature. It starts at 15 degrees, drops to a low of 12 degrees at 6:00, rises steadily to a peak of 28 degrees at 15:00, and then falls back to 18 degrees by the end of the day.\"`\n\n**D. Network Graph (`networkx`)**\n*   **Description:** Describe the overall structure and layout (e.g., dense, sparse, clustered, `spring_layout`, `circular_layout`). Detail the nodes (entities) and edges (relationships). For each node, give its label and any attributes. For each edge, describe the two nodes it connects and the nature of their relationship (which can be indicated by edge color or style).\n*   **Example:** `\"A network graph of character relationships arranged in a spring layout. There are three primary nodes. The central node, labeled 'Protagonist A', is a large blue circle. It is connected by a thick, solid black line (representing friendship) to a node labeled 'Character B', a smaller green circle. 'Protagonist A' is also connected by a thin, dashed red line (representing conflict) to a node labeled 'Character C', a small red square. The graph shows a central cluster around the protagonist.\"`\n\n#### 3. Accessibility Guidance\n\nAdherence to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) is crucial for ensuring descriptions are usable by everyone.\n\n*   **Use of Color (WCAG 1.4.1):** Color should never be the *only* means of conveying information. Always supplement color with text labels, patterns, or shapes. For example, instead of \"the red line shows sales,\" use \"the solid red line shows sales, while the dashed blue line shows profits.\"\n*   **Contrast (WCAG 1.4.3 & 1.4.11):** While for visual display, the principle of distinguishability is key. Non-text elements like graph lines and bar borders should have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 with adjacent colors. Text descriptions should differentiate elements clearly.\n*   **Colorblind-Safe Descriptors:**\n    *   **Palettes:** Use colorblind-safe palettes. Matplotlib's perceptually uniform colormaps like `viridis`, `plasma`, `cividis`, and `inferno` are excellent choices. Avoid problematic colormaps like 'jet' or 'rainbow'.\n    *   **Non-Color Cues:** Use patterns and shapes to differentiate elements. Matplotlib supports various hatch styles for bars (e.g., '/', '|', '+', 'x', '*') and numerous marker styles for lines (e.g., 'o', 's', '^', 'v', 'D').\n\n#### 4. Tips to Avoid Ambiguity\n\n*   **Be Specific and Quantitative:** Use exact values, units, and ranges. Avoid vague terms like \"high,\" \"low,\" or \"a lot.\"\n*   **Use a Logical Flow:** Describe the visualization in a predictable order, such as left-to-right, top-to-bottom, or chronologically for time-series data.\n*   **Focus on Data and Trends:** Prioritize the essential information and insights the visualization is meant to convey over purely aesthetic details.\n*   **Maintain Consistency:** Use the same terminology and descriptive patterns throughout all descriptions in the curriculum.\n*   **Use Clear Spatial Language:** Employ precise terms for position and direction (e.g., 'top-left corner', 'adjacent to', 'parallel with').\n\n#### 5. Student Reflection Prompts\n\nTo ensure students have correctly interpreted the textual description, pose questions that test their comprehension:\n\n*   \"Based on this description, could you accurately sketch the graph or drawing?\"\n*   \"What is the primary trend or key takeaway from this visualization?\"\n*   \"How would you explain this visualization to someone who cannot see it?\"\n*   \"If you were to recreate this visualization, what Python commands would correspond to each element described?\"\n*   \"Are there any parts of the description that are unclear or could be more precise?\"\n*   \"What specific data points or relationships are highlighted in the description?\"",
    "oracle_prompt_templates": "### Comprehensive Guide to Developing Student-Facing AI Prompt Templates for K-12 Coding Education\n\nThis report provides a detailed framework for creating effective and responsible student-facing prompt templates for an AI-powered coding workshop. It synthesizes key principles and best practices for engaging students aged 8–12 and 13–18, with a focus on generating Python code (`turtle`, `matplotlib`, `networkx`) and ensuring clarity under a strict text-only output constraint.\n\n#### **1. Foundational Guardrails for Responsible LLM Use in K-12**\n\nImplementing strong guardrails is paramount to ensure a safe, ethical, and effective learning environment. These principles should be embedded within the prompt templates and taught to students.\n\n*   **Data Privacy and Personal Information:** The most critical rule is to never use Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in AI systems. Students and staff must be explicitly instructed not to input personal, sensitive, or confidential data. All AI tools must comply with regulations like FERPA, COPPA, and CIPA. It is essential to review the Terms of Service and privacy policies of any AI tool to understand how student data is collected, used for model training, or shared. Parental/guardian consent is required for data collection activities.\n\n*   **Bias and Verification:** AI systems have inherent biases from their training data and can produce inaccurate information, known as 'hallucinations'. Students must be taught to use critical thinking to evaluate all AI-generated content. The AI should be treated as a starting point for inquiry, not a definitive authority. Outputs must be verified against credible sources before being used in academic work. AI systems themselves do not 'think' or understand accuracy.\n\n*   **Ethical Use and Academic Integrity:** AI should be positioned as a tool to enhance learning, not to circumvent effort or cheat. Clear classroom policies must define appropriate and inappropriate uses of AI for assignments, including proper citation methods. Prohibited uses include passing off AI work as one's own or using AI to create misinformation or for bullying.\n\n*   **Human Oversight and Critical Thinking:** AI is a partner, not a replacement for human teachers or student intellect. Human inquiry, reflection, and critical thinking should always begin and end the process of using AI. Students should be empowered to evaluate the credibility, bias, and accuracy of AI-driven media and actively shape how AI is used in their learning journey.\n\n*   **Age-Appropriate Engagement and Transparency:** AI concepts must be explained using age-appropriate language. \n    *   **For Ages 8–12:** Focus on foundational ideas. Explain that AI is a tool created by people, it learns from lots of information, and it can be very helpful (e.g., Khan Academy's tutor). Teach simple safety rules like not sharing personal information and asking a trusted adult if they see something confusing or upsetting. Emphasize that AI can sometimes be wrong or biased.\n    *   **For Ages 13–18:** Introduce more complex topics. Discuss data privacy in-depth (how data is collected, stored, and may not remain private), algorithmic bias, and the ethical implications of AI. Reinforce the importance of critical thinking, verifying outputs, and understanding AI's limitations.\n\n#### **2. Best Practices for Prompt Design and Engineering**\n\nEffective prompts are clear, specific, and structured to guide the LLM toward the desired output while respecting all constraints.\n\n*   **Clear and Specific Instructions:** Begin the prompt with the primary task. Be explicit and detailed, leaving as little to interpretation as possible.\n\n*   **Structured Output:** Use clear syntax like headings, bullet points, or JSON-like structures to define the output format. For code generation, explicitly state the programming language (Python), required libraries (`turtle`, `matplotlib`, `networkx`), and the desired structure of the response (e.g., separate sections for code and description).\n\n*   **Enforcing the Text-Only Constraint:** This is a critical instruction. The prompt must explicitly command the LLM to produce a *detailed textual description* of the visual output and strictly forbid the generation of image files, external file access, or interactive displays.\n\n*   **Few-Shot Learning:** Include 1-2 examples of a desired input/output pair within the prompt. This conditions the model to better understand the expected format, especially for the dual output of code and textual description.\n\n*   **Guardrails for Code Generation:** Embed warnings and instructions within the prompt to ensure the generated code is runnable and self-contained. For example: \"The Python code you generate must not require any external files for input or output.\"\n\n*   **Provide an 'Out':** Instruct the model on how to respond if it cannot fulfill the request. For example: \"If you cannot generate the code and description as requested, respond with 'Cannot generate' and explain why.\" This prevents the model from fabricating incorrect answers.\n\n#### **3. Guidelines for Crafting Text-Only Descriptions of Visuals**\n\nSince no images can be rendered, the textual description becomes the primary output. It must be rich and detailed.\n\n*   **Two-Part Text Alternative:** For complex visuals like charts and graphs, the description should have two parts: a short description to identify the image (e.g., \"A bar chart of semester grades\") and a long description providing all essential information.\n\n*   **Detailed Long Descriptions:** The long description must be a comprehensive textual representation. For a chart, this includes the title, axis labels, scales, data values, relationships between data points, and trends. For a drawing, it should describe shapes, colors, positions, and the overall composition.\n\n*   **Universal Availability:** The long description should be presented as part of the main content, making it accessible to all students, not just those using assistive technologies.\n\n*   **Context and Purpose:** The description should communicate the *meaning* and *purpose* of the visual, not just be a list of its parts. For example, instead of \"There are four bars,\" say \"The bar chart compares grades across four subjects, with Science being the highest.\"\n\n*   **Data Tables:** For charts and graphs, supplementing the text summary with a simple data table is an excellent way to present the precise values clearly.\n\n#### **4. Empowering Students: Verification and Follow-Up**\n\nStudents should be encouraged to engage critically and iteratively with the AI.\n\n*   **Tips for Verifying Outputs:**\n    *   **Cross-Referencing:** Compare any factual information from the AI with other reliable sources.\n    *   **Manual Code Review:** Read through the generated code to check for logic errors and ensure it adheres to the prompt's constraints.\n    *   **Testing:** Run the code to see if it executes without errors and if its behavior matches the textual description provided by the AI.\n    *   **Critical Thinking:** Always maintain a healthy skepticism. Question outputs that seem too perfect or contradict known information.\n\n*   **Hints on Asking Follow-Up Questions:**\n    *   Encourage students to ask for clarification if an output is confusing (e.g., \"Can you explain what this line of code does?\").\n    *   Prompt them to ask for alternatives if the first solution isn't what they wanted (e.g., \"Can you show me how to draw this using circles instead of squares?\").\n    *   Promote iterative refinement by asking the AI to modify or build upon its previous response (e.g., \"Now add a blue roof to the house you just coded.\").\n\n#### **5. Prompt Template Examples**\n\nBelow are examples illustrating the application of these principles for different age groups and modules.\n\n**Example 1: Good vs. Weak Prompt (Ages 8-12, `turtle` module)**\n\n*   **Weak Prompt:** `draw a car`\n*   **Good Prompt:** `You are a helpful robot that teaches drawing with code. Your task is to write Python code using the 'turtle' library to draw a simple car. The car should have a rectangle body and two circle wheels. After the code, write a paragraph describing exactly what the drawing looks like. Remember, you cannot show a picture, so describe the shapes, colors, and where they are. If you can't do it, just say 'I can't draw that yet.'`\n\n**Example 2: Good vs. Weak Prompt (Ages 13-18, `matplotlib` module)**\n\n*   **Weak Prompt:** `make a graph of phone usage`\n*   **Good Prompt:** `Act as a data analyst. Your task is to generate Python code using the 'matplotlib' library to create a line graph. The graph should plot the following data for daily screen time over a week: {Monday: 4.5, Tuesday: 5, Wednesday: 6, Thursday: 4, Friday: 7, Saturday: 8, Sunday: 7.5}. \n\n**Your output must have two parts:**\n1.  **Python Code:** A runnable Python script to generate the line graph. It must include a title ('Weekly Screen Time'), an x-axis label ('Day of the Week'), and a y-axis label ('Hours').\n2.  **Textual Description:** A detailed description of the graph. Describe the trend shown by the line (e.g., when it increases or decreases) and list the exact data points. Also, provide the data in a simple table format.\n\n**Constraint:** Do not generate an image file. Your entire output must be text.`",
    "troubleshooting_playbook": "This playbook is an instructor's guide for diagnosing and resolving common environment issues in a text-only Python workshop.\n\n**Part 1: Pre-Workshop Checks**\nProvide students with these commands to run before the workshop to catch issues early:\n*   **Check Tkinter:** `python -c \"import tkinter; print('Tkinter is installed successfully!')\"`\n*   **Check Matplotlib:** `python -c \"import matplotlib; print(f'Matplotlib is using the {matplotlib.get_backend()} backend.')\"`\n*   **Check NetworkX:** `python -c \"import networkx; print(f'NetworkX version {networkx.__version__} is installed.')\"`\n\n**Part 2: `turtle` / Tkinter GUI Issues**\n*Symptom-to-Cause Table:*\n| Symptom | Common Cause(s) |\n|---|---|\n| `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_tkinter'` | Python was installed without the Tcl/Tk libraries. This is common on Linux (`python3-tk` package missing) or if unchecked during Windows installation. |\n| `_tkinter.TclError: no display name...` | Trying to run a GUI application in a headless environment (like a remote server or Docker) without a display. |\n| `turtle` window closes immediately | The script finishes execution, closing the window. |\n\n*Remedies:*\n1.  **Window Closes Immediately:** Add `turtle.done()` or `turtle.mainloop()` as the last line of the script. This keeps the window open.\n2.  **`ModuleNotFoundError`:** This must be fixed at the system level. **Do not** use `pip install tkinter`. \n    *   **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):** `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`\n    *   **Linux (Fedora/RHEL):** `sudo dnf install python3-tkinter`\n    *   **Windows:** Re-run the Python installer, select 'Modify', and ensure the 'tcl/tk and IDLE' box is checked.\n    *   **macOS:** Use an official Python installer from python.org, which bundles Tcl/Tk. If using `pyenv`, install `tcl-tk` via Homebrew *before* installing the Python version.\n3.  **`no display name` Error:** This is expected in a text-only environment. Reassure the student this is not a problem for the workshop's goals. Pivot to the 'Offline Teaching Strategy' below.\n\n**Part 3: `matplotlib` Backend/Display Issues**\n*Symptom-to-Cause Table:*\n| Symptom | Common Cause(s) |\n|---|---|\n| `UserWarning: Matplotlib is currently using agg...` | Matplotlib has correctly defaulted to a non-GUI backend (`agg`) because no graphical interface is available. This is not an error in a headless environment. |\n| `ValueError: x and y must have same first dimension...` | A logical error. The lists for x-axis labels and y-axis values have different lengths. |\n| `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'matplotlib'` | The library is not installed. |\n\n*Remedies:*\n1.  **`agg` Warning:** This is the desired behavior for our text-only constraint. The fix is to replace `plt.show()` with `plt.savefig('output.png')` and then describe the saved file textually. The script must also include `import matplotlib; matplotlib.use('Agg')` at the very top.\n2.  **`ValueError` (Mismatched Data):** This is a teachable moment. Guide the student to use `print(len(x))` and `print(len(y))` to debug their lists and ensure they have the same number of items.\n3.  **`ModuleNotFoundError`:** Install the library: `pip install matplotlib`.\n\n**Part 4: `networkx` Installation Issues**\n*Symptom-to-Cause Table:*\n| Symptom | Common Cause(s) |\n|---|---|\n| `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'networkx'` | The `networkx` package is not installed. |\n| Drawing code fails (`nx.draw()`) | `networkx` uses `matplotlib` for drawing. The root cause is a `matplotlib` backend issue (see Part 3). |\n\n*Remedies:*\n1.  **`ModuleNotFoundError`:** Install the library. For best results, install it with its common dependencies: `pip install networkx[default]`.\n2.  **Drawing Fails:** Troubleshoot the `matplotlib` installation and backend configuration as described in Part 3.\n\n**Part 5: Pedagogical Troubleshooting & Communication**\n*   **Offline Teaching Strategy (If Live Execution Fails):**\n    1.  **Reassure:** 'Don't worry! The goal isn't to see a picture, but to understand the code's magic. Your environment is just being extra careful.'\n    2.  **Focus on Logic:** Walk through the code line-by-line. Ask, 'What is this line *supposed* to do? How would you describe that in words?'\n    3.  **Use Pre-Generated Output:** Provide the student with the correct textual description and have them compare their code's logic to the target output.\n\n*   **'Counter-Jinx' Debugging Rituals for Students:**\n    1.  **The 'Print Everything' Spell:** Before a failing line, `print()` the variables to see what they contain.\n    2.  **The 'Restart Python' Charm:** In interactive sessions, restarting the kernel or terminal can clear hidden problems.\n    3.  **The 'Google Incantation':** Teach students to copy the exact error message into a search engine with the library name.\n\n*   **Communicating Constraints (In-Universe Language):**\n    *   'In our workshop, our magical quills don't draw pictures on screen; they write vivid *descriptions* of the magic for our imagination to paint. If you see an error about 'no display', it just means the quill is trying to draw when it should be describing!'",

These include:\n\n*   **In-Workshop Quick Checks:**\n    *   **Think-Pair-Share:** Used after explaining a concept, students discuss a question with a partner before sharing with the class (e.g., 'What would you change to draw a rectangle instead of a square?').\n    *   **Exit Tickets:** Students write a brief response on a sticky note to a prompt like 'Write one thing the chart tells you and one question you still have.' This assesses data interpretation and identifies confusion.\n    *   **Thumbs Check:** A quick, non-verbal poll to gauge understanding of key vocabulary (e.g., 'Thumbs up if you understand what a 'node' is.').\n\n*   **Structured Quick Checks (Per Module):**\n    *   **Code Tracing:** Students are given code and asked to manually track the values of variables to predict the final state, reinforcing their mental model of execution.\n    *   **Predicting Output:** Students are given a code snippet and must write down the exact textual output, directly assessing their understanding of commands (e.g., 'What will `print(\"Hello\" * 3)` display?').\n    *   **Parsons Problems:** Students are given a jumbled set of code lines and must arrange them in the correct logical order to form a working program. This is excellent for teaching structure without requiring typing or live execution.\n    *   **Snippet Analysis:** Students are shown a small piece of code and asked to identify an error, explain its purpose, or suggest an improvement (e.g., 'What is the purpose of `turtle.penup()`?').",

    "mathematical_magic_compendium": "### Mathematical Magic Compendium\n\nThis compendium distills the core mathematical and logical concepts for a middle school coding workshop. It is designed to support a 'prompt -> code -> graph' pedagogical flow where the 'graph' is a detailed textual description of a visual output. Each module links concepts to Python libraries (`turtle`, `matplotlib`, `networkx`), simple explanations, and engaging activities.\n\n--- \n\n### Module 1: Geometric Art with Turtle\n\n**Core Concepts:** Cartesian Coordinates, Angles, Polygons, Circles\n\n**Python Library:** `turtle`\n\n**1. Core Math & Logic Concepts:**\n*   **Coordinates:** The foundation of positioning objects in a 2D space. The `turtle` screen is a virtual canvas, a Cartesian plane with the origin (0,0) at the center ('Home'). The default canvas size is often 400x400 pixels. Every point on the screen can be identified by an (x, y) pair.\n*   **Angles:** Angles measure rotation and are essential for changing direction. In `turtle`, angles are measured in degrees and are used to turn the turtle left or right from its current heading. This is the key to drawing any shape that isn't a straight line.\n*   **Polygons:** These are 2D shapes made of straight lines (e.g., triangles, squares, hexagons). The logic for drawing a regular polygon involves repeating a two-step process: move forward, then turn by an external angle. The turn angle for a regular n-sided polygon is calculated as 360 / n.\n*   **Circles & Arcs:** A circle is a shape where all points on its edge are equidistant from the center. An arc is a portion of a circle's circumference. The `turtle` library can draw these shapes directly, often by approximating a circle as a many-sided polygon (e.g., a 60-sided polygon).\n\n**2. Simple Explanations & Python Commands:**\n*   **Getting Started:** For beginners, using `from turtle import *` simplifies code by allowing direct use of commands like `forward()` instead of `turtle.forward()`. The turtle itself is a cursor, which can be made to look like a turtle with `shape('turtle')`.\n*   **Movement & Positioning:**\n    *   `goto(x, y)`: Moves the turtle to an absolute position on the screen. Example: `goto(0, 100)` moves the turtle to the top-center part of the screen.\n    *   `forward(distance)` or `fd(distance)`: Moves the turtle forward by a set number of pixels.\n    *   `rt(angle)` / `lt(angle)`: Rotates the turtle right or left by a specified number of degrees.\n*   **Drawing Shapes:**\n    *   **Square:** Repeat `forward(100)` and `rt(90)` four times.\n    *   **Circle:** Use `circle(radius)` to draw a circle with a given radius. `circle(radius, extent)` can draw an arc, where `extent` is an angle in degrees.\n    *   **Dot:** `dot()` draws a filled-in circle at the turtle's current position.\n*   **Styling and Control:**\n    *   `pencolor(\"blue\")`: Changes the line color.\n    *   `fillcolor(\"yellow\")`: Sets the color to be used for filling a shape.\n    *   `begin_fill()` and `end_fill()`: Call these before and after drawing a shape to fill it with the `fillcolor`.\n    *   `hideturtle()` / `showturtle()`: Makes the turtle cursor invisible or visible.\n\n**3. Everyday Analogies & Extension Ideas:**\n*   **Analogy:** Think of the turtle as a robot pen that you can give instructions to. `goto(x,y)` is like telling it to go to a specific spot on a map. `forward()` and `rt()` are like telling someone to 'walk 10 steps, then turn right'.\n*   **Extension Problems:**\n    1.  **Draw a House:** Combine a square for the base and a triangle for the roof.\n    2.  **Create a Snowman:** Use `goto()` to position three circles of decreasing size on top of each other. Use `dot()` for the eyes and buttons.\n    3.  **Draw Constellations:** Look up the coordinates of stars in a simple constellation like the Big Dipper and use `goto()` and `dot()` to plot them.\n    4.  **Geometric Patterns:** Use a loop to draw a shape (like a square) multiple times, turning slightly after each one is complete to create a spiraling pattern.\n\n--- \n\n### Module 2: Data Stories with Bar Charts\n\n**Core Concepts:** Categorical Data, Counts, Comparisons, Ratios\n\n**Python Library:** `matplotlib`\n\n**1. Core Math & Logic Concepts:**\n*   **Categorical Data:** Information that can be sorted into groups or categories, rather than being measured numerically. Examples include favorite colors, types of pets, or months of the year.\n*   **Counts (Frequency):** The number of times each category appears in a dataset. A frequency table is a simple way to organize this data before graphing.\n*   **Comparisons:** Bar charts excel at showing comparisons between the counts of different categories. The length or height of the bar is proportional to the value, making it easy to see which category has more or less.\n*   **Ratios:** A ratio compares two quantities. A bar chart can visually represent a ratio. For example, if a chart shows 8 dogs and 4 cats, the bars visually represent the 8:4 (or 2:1) ratio.\n\n**2. Simple Explanations & Python Commands:**\n*   **Bar Charts:** These graphs use rectangular bars to represent data. They are ideal for showing how many items are in different categories.\n*   **Python Commands:**\n    *   `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`: The standard way to import the library.\n    *   `categories = ['Dogs', 'Cats', 'Birds']`\n    *   `counts = [8, 6, 3]`\n    *   `plt.bar(categories, counts)`: This is the core function. It takes the list of category names for the x-axis and their corresponding values for the y-axis.\n    *   `plt.barh(categories, counts)`: Creates a horizontal bar chart.\n    *   `plt.xlabel('Pet Type')`, `plt.ylabel('Number of Students')`, `plt.title('Pets Owned by Students')`: Functions to label the chart axes and give it a title.\n    *   `plt.show()`: Displays the chart (in a standard environment).\n\n**3. Textual Description of a Bar Chart (for 'graph' output):**\n*   Given the text-only constraint, describing the chart is crucial. A good description follows a two-part structure:\n    *   **Short Description (Alt Text):** A one-sentence summary. E.g., \"A vertical bar chart showing the number of students who own different types of pets.\"\n    *   **Long Description:** A detailed textual representation. E.g., \"A vertical bar chart titled 'Pets Owned by Students'. The horizontal x-axis is labeled 'Pet Type' and shows three categories: 'Dogs', 'Cats', and 'Birds'. The vertical y-axis is labeled 'Number of Students' and ranges from 0 to 10. The bar for 'Dogs' reaches a value of 8. The bar for 'Cats' reaches a value of 6. The bar for 'Birds' reaches a value of 3. The chart shows that dogs are the most common pet, followed by cats, and then birds.\"\n\n**4. Everyday Analogies & Extension Ideas:**\n*   **Analogy:** A bar chart is like a skyline where each building represents a category, and the height of the building tells you its value.\n*   **Extension Problems:**\n    1.  **Class Survey:** Conduct a survey in class (e.g., favorite ice cream flavor, birth month). Collect the data, create a frequency table, and write the Python code to generate a bar chart. Then, write the full textual description of the resulting chart.\n    2.  **Ratio Exploration:** Create a bar chart for a simple ratio problem (e.g., 'For every 2 apples, there are 3 oranges'). The chart would have two bars, one for 'Apples' with a height of 2 and one for 'Oranges' with a height of 3.\n\n--- \n\n### Module 3: Uncovering Trends in Data\n\n**Core Concepts:** Trends, Rate of Change, Maxima/Minima, Simple Smoothing\n\n**Python Library:** `matplotlib`\n\n**1. Core Math & Logic Concepts:**\n*   **Trends:** The general direction in which data is changing over time (e.g., increasing, decreasing, or staying constant).\n*   **Rate of Change:** How quickly a value is changing over a period. On a graph, this is represented by the slope or steepness of the line. A steep upward line means a fast positive rate of change.\n*   **Maxima/Minima:** These are the highest ('peak') and lowest ('valley') points in a dataset. A 'maximum' is where the trend changes from increasing to decreasing. A 'minimum' is where it changes from decreasing to increasing.\n*   **Simple Smoothing (Moving Averages):** A technique to make trends clearer by smoothing out short-term fluctuations. A moving average is calculated by averaging a set of data points over a specific time window, then sliding the window forward.\n\n**2. Simple Explanations & Python Commands:**\n*   **Line Graphs:** Used to show how data changes over a continuous period, like time. They are perfect for visualizing trends, peaks, and valleys.\n*   **Python Commands:**\n    *   `import matplotlib.pyplot as plt`\n    *   `time = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`\n    *   `temperature = [65, 68, 72, 71, 65, 64, 66]`\n    *   `plt.plot(time, temperature)`: The core function to create a line graph.\n    *   `plt.xlabel('Day')`, `plt.ylabel('Temperature (F)')`, `plt.title('Weekly Temperature')`: Functions for labeling.\n\n**3. Everyday Analogies & Extension Ideas:**\n*   **Analogy:**\n    *   **Rate of Change:** Like the speed of a car. A steep line on a distance-time graph means you're going fast.\n    *   **Maxima/Minima:** Like the path of a roller coaster. The highest point is the maximum; the lowest point is the minimum.\n    *   **Moving Average:** Like looking at your average grade over the last three tests to see if you're generally improving, ignoring a single bad or good score.\n*   **Extension Problems:**\n    1.  **Personal Data:** Track something for a week (e.g., how many minutes you read each day, the temperature outside). Plot it on a line graph and describe the trends, identifying any peaks (maxima) or valleys (minima).\n    2.  **Calculate a Moving Average:** Using a list of daily temperatures, manually calculate a 3-day moving average and plot it on the same graph as the original data to see the smoothing effect.\n\n--- \n\n### Module 4: The Secrets of Networks\n\n**Core Concepts:** Nodes, Edges, Degree, Paths, Centrality\n\n**Python Library:** `networkx`\n\n**1. Core Math & Logic Concepts:**\n*   **Graph Theory:** This is not about plotting data points; it's about studying relationships. A graph is a collection of objects and the connections between them.\n*   **Nodes (or Vertices):** The objects in the network. In a social network, the nodes are people.\n*   **Edges (or Links):** The connections between the nodes. An edge between two people could mean they are friends.\n*   **Degree:** The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it. It's a simple measure of a node's direct influence or popularity.\n*   **Path:** A sequence of nodes and edges that connects one node to another. The famous 'six degrees of separation' idea is about finding a short path between any two people in the world.\n*   **Centrality:** A measure of a node's importance in a network. **Betweenness Centrality** is a key type; it measures how often a node lies on the shortest path between two other nodes. A node with high betweenness centrality acts as a 'bridge' or 'connector' between different parts of the network.\n\n**2. Simple Explanations & Python Commands:**\n*   **NetworkX:** A powerful Python library for creating, analyzing, and visualizing networks of nodes and edges.\n*   **Python Commands:**\n    *   `import networkx as nx`: The standard import.\n    *   `G = nx.Graph()`: Creates an empty graph.\n    *   `G.add_node(\"Alice\")` or `G.add_nodes_from([\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\"])`: Adds one or more nodes.\n    *   `G.add_edge(\"Alice\", \"Bob\")` or `G.add_edges_from([(\"Alice\", \"Bob\"), (\"Bob\", \"Charlie\")])`: Adds one or more edges.\n    *   `G.degree(\"Alice\")`: Calculates the degree of a node.\n    *   `nx.betweenness_centrality(G)`: Calculates the betweenness centrality for all nodes in the graph.\n\n**3. Textual Description of a Network Graph:**\n*   A textual description should list the components and key metrics. E.g., \"A network graph representing a small social network. The network contains three nodes: 'Alice', 'Bob', and 'Charlie'. There are two edges connecting the nodes: one between 'Alice' and 'Bob', and one between 'Bob' and 'Charlie'. Analysis of the network shows the following degrees: Alice has a degree of 1, Bob has a degree of 2, and Charlie has a degree of 1. The betweenness centrality scores indicate that Bob is the most central node, acting as a bridge between Alice and Charlie.\"\n\n**4. Everyday Analogies & Extension Ideas:**\n*   **Analogy:** Think of your friend group as a network. Each person is a node, and a line (edge) exists between two people if they are friends. The person with the most friends has the highest degree. The person who connects two different friend groups has high betweenness centrality.\n*   **Extension Problems:**\n    1.  **Map Your Social Network:** On paper, draw your family or a small group of friends as a network. Who has the highest degree? Who is the 'bridge' connecting others?\n    2.  **Fictional Character Network:** Choose a short story or a chapter from a book (e.g., Harry Potter, Game of Thrones). Create a network where nodes are characters and an edge exists if they interact. Use `networkx` to model this and calculate who has the highest degree and betweenness centrality. Write a textual description of your findings.",
    "accessibility_and_inclusion_plan": "This plan ensures the workshop is accessible and inclusive for all learners within a text-only environment, guided by Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles.\n\n**1. Color and Visual Accessibility:**\n*   **Colorblind-Safe Descriptions:** When describing colors in the 'Enchanted Visualization' sections, use palettes designed for accessibility, such as the Okabe-Ito palette. Textual descriptions will name these colors (e.g., 'a vivid orange', 'a distinct blue').\n*   **Alternatives to Color-Coding:** Adhering to WCAG 1.4.1, color will never be the sole means of conveying information. Textual descriptions will always supplement color with non-color cues. For example:\n    *   **Bar Charts:** Bars will be described with distinct patterns ('diagonal hatching', 'solid fill') in addition to color.\n    *   **Line Graphs:** Lines will be described with different styles ('solid', 'dashed', 'dotted') and markers ('circles', 'squares', 'triangles').\n    *   **Direct Labeling:** Descriptions will emphasize direct labels on data points over relying on a separate legend, as this is clearer.\n\n**2. Cognitive Load and Readability:**\n*   **Pacing:** The workshop will use a 'Participatory Live Coding' method, where the instructor codes in real-time. This naturally slows the pace and allows for adaptation. Regular checkpoints using a sticky note system (green for 'done', red for 'stuck') provide silent, real-time feedback.\n*   **Worked Examples:** The curriculum's five-part structure provides a complete worked example for each concept, which is highly effective for initial skill acquisition and reduces cognitive load.\n*   **Plain Language:** All instructions and explanations will use clear, simple, and direct language, avoiding jargon where possible and explaining necessary technical terms with analogies.\n*   **Structure:** The document will use a clear, numbered heading structure (ISO 2145) to allow for easy navigation and skimming.\n\n**3. Inclusive Participation and Cultural Sensitivity:**\n*   **Pair Programming:** This is the primary collaboration strategy. Students work in pairs with defined 'Driver' (types the code) and 'Navigator' (observes, suggests, and catches errors) roles. Roles are switched regularly to ensure equitable participation and prevent any one student from dominating.\n*   **Adaptations for Typing Speed:** The Driver/Navigator model naturally accommodates different typing speeds. Additionally, providing code templates and starter code reduces the amount of typing required, allowing students to focus on the core logic.\n*   **Culturally Sensitive Content:** The Harry Potter theme will be handled respectfully, focusing on positive character traits and avoiding controversial plotlines. When adapting to other themes, age-appropriate content guidelines (e.g., from Common Sense Media) will be followed to ensure material is suitable for the entire 8-18 age range.\n\n**4. Text-Only Environment Strategy:**\n*   The core of the accessibility plan is the 'Enchanted Visualization' itself. By replacing actual images with detailed, structured textual descriptions, the workshop becomes inherently accessible to screen readers and removes barriers for students who have difficulty interpreting complex visuals. These descriptions will follow a standardized format: a short summary followed by a detailed breakdown of all components, data, and trends.",
    "ip_and_ethical_considerations": "This summary outlines the key risks, ethical considerations, and IP-safe usage notes for the Harry Potter-themed workshop, along with proposed mitigations.\n\n**1. Intellectual Property (IP) and Copyright:**\n*   **Risk:** Using copyrighted names, characters, and plot elements without permission could infringe on the rights of the IP holders (J.K. Rowling, Warner Bros.).\n*   **Mitigation (Fair Use/Fair Dealing):** The workshop's non-commercial, educational purpose strongly supports a 'fair use' (US) or 'fair dealing' (UK) argument. To strengthen this position:\n    *   **Disclaimer:** A clear disclaimer will be included in all materials and stated verbally: 'This workshop is for educational purposes only and is not affiliated with, sponsored, or endorsed by any Harry Potter rights holders. Content is used under the principles of fair use for non-commercial instruction.'\n    *   **No Direct Quotes:** The curriculum will paraphrase plot points and character descriptions rather than using direct quotations from the books or films.\n    *   **Transformative Use:** The content is used in a transformative way—to teach coding concepts—which is a key tenet of fair use.\n    *   **Text-Only Constraint:** The inability to generate images or logos is a primary mitigation against trademark and visual copyright infringement.\n\n**2. Age-Appropriate Content:**\n*   **Risk:** The Harry Potter series matures significantly, with later books containing themes of violence and death that may be unsuitable for younger students (ages 8-11).\n*   **Mitigation:**\n    *   **Content Curation:** The workshop will primarily reference characters, spells, and scenarios from the first three books, which are widely considered appropriate for ages 8+. More complex themes will be reserved for advanced modules targeting older students (14-18).\n    *   **Parental Communication:** Parents will be informed about the thematic content to allow for informed consent.\n\n**3. Respectful Character Selection and Inclusivity:**\n*   **Risk:** The author and certain character portrayals have faced public criticism. Using these elements without consideration could create a non-inclusive environment.\n*   **Mitigation:** The curriculum will focus on characters known for positive traits like bravery, loyalty, and intelligence (e.g., Harry, Hermione, Ron) and will avoid characters or plotlines that are widely considered controversial.\n\n**4. Data Privacy and Use of LLMs:**\n*   **Risk:** Using an LLM ('The Oracle') in a K-12 setting raises significant data privacy concerns under regulations like COPPA and FERPA. The collection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is a major risk.\n*   **Mitigation:**\n    *   **Strict No-PII Policy:** A critical rule will be enforced: students must not enter any PII (names, emails, etc.) into the LLM. All interactions will be anonymous.\n    *   **Vendor Vetting:** Any LLM or online platform used must be vetted to ensure it is compliant with educational privacy laws and that student data is not used for model training or advertising.\n    *   **Informed Consent:** Parents must provide informed consent that clearly outlines the use of the LLM and the privacy safeguards in place.\n\n**5. Contingency Plan:**\n*   **Risk:** Unforeseen issues (e.g., parental concerns, school policy changes) may require a rapid pivot away from the Harry Potter theme.\n*   **Mitigation:** An alternative, generic theme (e.g., 'Magical Creatures' or 'Space Exploration') will be prepared in advance. The modular design of the curriculum allows the core coding lessons to remain intact while the thematic wrapper is swapped out."

They show runnable-like steps and narration around constructing a specific Deathly Hallows motif with a turtle, which closely mirrors the workshop's Module 1 approach of using Python turtle to produce a recognizable magical symbol and immediate visual effects through code blocks described textually. The general turtle graphics excerpts complement this by outlining how turtle works, what the turtle represents, and how to structure simple drawings, which underpins the narrative hook and the Python Incantation components of the five-part module sequence in your field value. Additionally, excerpts on bar plotting and time-series plotting illustrate how the curriculum could extend to Module 2 and Module 3, where students produce graphs (drawn textually when no actual graphic window is available) and interpret them, aligning with the \"graph\" outcomes described in the field value, including a text-only description of visuals when no external files or images are permitted. Taken together, these excerpts support the core architecture of a two-hour, text-only, mixed-age workshop with a potion-like framing around Python-based spellcasting, starting with Deathly Hallows through turtle and progressing to data visualization, all within a Hogwarts-inspired five-part module flow.

Excerpts that describe the role of alt text and long descriptions for complex images establish a foundation for how to convey chart or diagram information without visuals. For example, guidance that complex images require short alt text plus a long description, and that long descriptions may be provided in surrounding text or via a longdesc attribute, directly supports the plan's aim to replace visual content with text-based equivalents and to offload information from color or graphic cues to structured descriptions. Additional excerpts outline best practices for alt text to describe chart type and data, and for providing long descriptions that accompany images, which aligns with the plan's need for precise, screen-reader-friendly narratives in a text-only workshop setting. The inclusion of WCAG and UDL-related guidance reinforces the requirement to design content and descriptions that are perceivable and accessible to diverse learners, including those with vision or cognitive differences. The described strategies—colorblind-safe alternatives, patterns in place of color, direct labeling, and the use of legible text descriptions—map cleanly onto the plan's objectives for a universally accessible curriculum. Cross-cutting mentions of long descriptions and the need to provide accessible data representations in text form further anchor the field's value in a clearly defined accessibility framework. Taken together, these excerpts collectively support the field's premise by offering concrete, standards-based text-only accessibility practices that can be operationalized in a Harry Potter-themed, UDl-guided workshop.",

Direct references in the excerpts outline the core components of this approach: the use of a short alt-text that identifies the image and points to a longer description, and the long description that provides an in-depth, structured narrative of the graphic including overview, axes, data points, trends, and annotations. The material also describes two-part descriptions for complex images, including where to place the long description and how to structure it (overview, dimensions, axes, data values, trends, and annotations). Additional excerpts discuss how to describe non-graph images like turtle drawings and how to ensure color use is not the sole conveyance of information, which reinforces the need for text-based cues and patterns in text-only descriptions. Taken together, these excerpts directly support the concept of a standardized, text-only description workflow for complex visuals in an instructional flow that relies on text rather than rendered images. The content also covers accessibility practices such as alt text, long descriptions, and non-color cues, which underpin the practical guidance in the requested field value. Overall, the strongest support is for two-part text descriptions, long-form descriptions, and explicit structure for data visuals, which matches the field value's emphasis on a standardized template and accessibility.

The most directly relevant excerpts are those that explicitly present a Deathly Hallows-themed Turtle Python tutorial, i.e., a Deathly Hallows drawing implemented in Python Turtle, including code and step-by-step commands. These excerpts demonstrate applying Python turtle programming to produce a magical symbol, which closely mirrors the requested metaphor-driven pedagogy. The sequence of Deathly Hallows-related excerpts provides concrete, in-text examples of a magical-themed Python activity that could underpin the narrative framework described in the field value. Adjacent excerpts that discuss Python Turtle basics and introductory turtle tutorials also align with the concept of using magical/metaphorical framing to teach Python concepts, since turtle graphics are often used to illustrate geometry and programming concepts in a visually engaging, learner-friendly way. Finally, additional turtle/Python introductory materials that discuss turtle usage and general graphics can be mapped onto the same metaphor framework, serving as supportive context for building out the glossary and mapping terms to spells and magical ingredients. Overall, these excerpts collectively support the idea of a narrative framework that uses magical metaphors to teach Python concepts and to frame outputs as enchanted visuals, while ensuring the content remains non-commercial and classroom-appropriate.",

      "reasoning": "The fine-grained field value centers on a formative assessment strategy embedded in a text-only, visual-output-constrained workshop. It specifies concrete, modular checks and activities designed to gauge understanding without relying on external files or images, plus a summative, integrative prompt describing a bar chart scenario. The most relevant excerpts explicitly discuss formative assessment methods and quick checks that fit this context. A passage describing quick, in-workshop checks and non-verbal polls directly supports the idea of lightweight, ongoing assessment during each module. It also mentions think-pair-share and exit tickets as mechanisms for immediate feedback and understanding checks, aligning with the field's emphasis on in-workshop, real-time feedback in a text-only setup. A second highly relevant excerpt addresses per-module quick checks and code-tracing tasks, which maps to the field's \"Structured Quick Checks (Per Module)\" bullet, including predicting output and identifying errors in code. A reference to Parsons Problems is pertinent because the field value explicitly includes a Parsons-style activity as a method to teach structure without requiring typing, which matches the source material describing Parsons problems as a learning strategy. A broader reference to a set of formative assessment resources in CS education provides supporting context for the general approach but is less directly tied to the exact module- and activity-level tactics. A secondary item describing a summative, integrative prompt for a chart-based visualization aligns with the field's summative challenge portion, though it is text-based and does not detail the in-workshop, step-by-step checks. Taken together, the most convincing support comes from the excerpts that spell out concrete, module-level quick checks and specific activities (code tracing, predicting outputs, Parsons problems) that mirror the field's described assessment strategy, followed by more general formative assessment guidance and the summative prompt example. The supporting evidence is coherent and points to a high level of alignment, though the corpus provides supplementary context rather than a single, explicit, line-for-line specification of the exact composite assessment_strategy. Therefore, confidence should be high for the core formative assessment elements and moderate for the broader framing and the summative prompt integration.",

Other excerpts flag common headless/headless-display errors like _tkinter.TclError: no display name and no $DISPLAY…, or ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_tkinter', and provide concrete remedies such as installing the Tk toolkit (python3-tk) on Linux or adjusting Python installations on other OSes. Additional excerpts cover switching backends or ensuring Tkinter is installed when GUI components are required for turtle/NetworkX drawing tasks. These pieces of evidence directly map to the field value's aim: a practical, pre-flight troubleshooting playbook for instructor-led, text-only workshops, including steps to verify environment readiness and concrete fixes for common GUI-related failures. The content about saving figures with Matplotlib when using the agg backend also ties to the recommended workflow for text-only contexts, reinforcing the playbook's guidance to avoid GUI-dependent rendering in headless setups. The most relevant parts provide explicit symptoms and concrete remedies (installing tkinter, headless backend, saving figures, etc.), while less directly relevant items cover peripheral backends or broader plotting guidance.\n\nBased on the breadth and directness of the support for the described troubleshooting approach, the confidence level is high.",

Also, another reason for the lack of observation of gamification’s impact on learning may be that students employ all their efforts and facilities to get good grades in the evaluations in both groups. So, measuring the students’ effort in acquiring this amount of learning and comparing it between the two groups can provide a better assessment. Our gamified content improved students' attitude toward the statistics, which can be explained by elements used in the design. The narrative of the gamified content focused on the usefulness of the player's activity in serving and helping others positively impacted the students' attitude regarding the value of statistics and its benefits. However, since the enjoyment of the intrinsic value of the statistics was not been targeted, it did not have much impact on students’ affect. It seems that the elements of point, feedback and scoreboard, through promoting self-efficacy and self-confidence, affected students’ attitude toward their cognitive competency. It is similar to the Sailor, et al.’s study that badges, leaderboards, and performance graphs affect competence need satisfaction and task meaningfulness ( [24]() )."

The strongest support comes from excerpts that explicitly present a House Points system or analogous classroom gamification frameworks: one excerpt documents a House Points system used in schools with notes on points, attendance, and competition structure; another excerpt discusses the spread and implementation of a House system in classrooms, outlining how points and houses function as motivational devices. Additional excerpts discuss concrete gamification elements in education (points for performance, debugging, creativity, and collaboration) and provide evidence that such systems can be designed to be fair (e.g., using averages to account for unequal group sizes) and complemented by rubrics and wise feedback. Several excerpts extend this concept into broader analyses of gamification in K-12 and its effects on motivation, engagement, and equity, as well as concrete rubric ideas for coding or data-visualization tasks, which align with the rubric portion of the finegrained field. Taken together, the most relevant materials directly map to the field's components (House Points scoring, four scoring categories with clearly defined rewards, and a risk-averse, fair rubric design), while the others supply context and validation about the broader practice of gamified learning and assessment rubrics that could inform the implementation described in the field value.",

The second most relevant excerpt explicitly mentions a 120-minute timeframe for a STEM activity module, reinforcing the same duration assertion and aligning with the blueprint's modular, time-boxed design. The third excerpt references a two-hour block as well (listed as 2 hours), which matches the overall duration required by the fine-grained field value and further supports the scheduling structure of a concise, bounded workshop.

Phrasing around obtaining licenses, submitting permissions requests, and acceptable and restricted uses informs how to structure prompts and activities that stay within legal boundaries when designing modules inspired by Marvel or Star Wars. Related items extend this by outlining fan-content policies for Marvel/Star Wars properties, which further clarifies the boundaries for classroom prompts, narratives, and visualization tasks that reference these universes. While other excerpts cover broader IP guidance or Harry Potter-specific licensing, the strongest, most actionable support for Marvel/Star Wars adaptations comes from licensing and permissions-focused excerpts, which explain process, eligibility, and contact points for obtaining rights or permissions to use IP in educational contexts. The inclusion of example scenarios or questions about how to adapt modules (e.g., Marvel Task: draw Captain America's shield) reflects the practical application of these licensing considerations in instructional design.",

The most relevant excerpt is the one describing a social-network style visualization for the wizarding world, since it directly matches a project about mapping relationships between characters (a NetworkX/graph-like task). Following that, the excerpt that details a Patronus tracer implemented via a Lissajous curve provides the closest match to a mathematical-curve based animation project, including the code scaffold for coordinates-based drawing. Even more directly, the Deathly Hallows project is represented by a Python turtle-based drawing tutorial that outlines constructing the Deathly Hallows symbol using turtle graphics, including example loops and turtle commands. Finally, an additional Deathly Hallows snippet shows iterative turtle drawing steps (e.g., looping constructs and turtle movements) that align with the described animation task's frame-by-frame, procedural approach. Taken together, these excerpts cover the three project themes (wizarding social network, Patronus/Lissajous animation, Deathly Hallows turtle animation) and provide concrete code blocks and narrative hooks that support the field value's components (project title, narrative hook, Python code, and descriptive visualization/mathematical description).",

      "reasoning": "Direct references to the field learning_modules describe four modules with specific visuals and code directions. The Deathly Hallows module is tied to turtle graphics and a runnable Python incantation to draw an equilateral triangle, a circle, and a bisecting line; this aligns with excerpts that explicitly show Deathly Hallows drawn with turtle and step-by-step turtle usage. Concrete excerpts demonstrate turtle-based drawing, including the Deathly Hallows symbol and related turtle setup, which map to the Narrative Hook, The Python Incantation, and The Enchanted Visualization parts of the module. Excerpts that discuss Python turtle basics and getting started provide grounding for the narrative hook and the initial turtle setup used across modules. For the Herbology Data module, bar chart demonstrations use matplotlib to visualize categorical plant uses, including axis labels and bar heights, illustrating the Python Incantation and Enchanted Visualization for a bar chart. The Divination & The House Cup module is supported by excerpts showing line graphs with matplotlib, plotting multiple series over time, with axis labels, grid, and a legend, which directly reflect the narrative hook and the Python incantation required for time-series visualization. Finally, The Marauder's Map module uses NetworkX to draw a network graph representing relationships, with examples of adding edges and plotting a social network, matching the Narrative Hook, The Oracle's Prompt, and The Python Incantation for network graphs. The included excerpts also touch on the broader context of rendering visuals (matplotlib backends, headless execution) which underpins the Enchanted Visualization and ensures the engineer can run visuals in various environments. Overall, the strongest, most direct support comes from excerpts that depict Deathly Hallows turtle drawing, bar plots with matplotlib, time-series line graphs with matplotlib, and NetworkX network visualizations, all of which map cleanly to the four learning modules described in the finegrained field value.",

      "reasoning": "The fine-grained field value outlines a comprehensive framework for developing student-facing AI prompt templates in K-12 coding education, emphasizing guardrails, structured outputs, and age-appropriate design. Several excerpts directly address core elements of this field value: explicit guidance on prompt design and engineering, including how to craft prompts that produce runnable Python code along with descriptive text, and how to constrain outputs to text-only formats when needed. There is also explicit discussion of structured outputs (e.g., JSON-like outputs, using structured sections for code and description), and guidance on how to frame prompts for different age groups (8–12 and 13–18) with appropriate complexity and pedagogy. In addition, multiple excerpts present best practices for prompt templates in educational contexts, including example prompt structures, requirements for outputs (two-part descriptions: short identification plus long description; data tables accompanying visuals), and鼓励 verification and critical thinking in students when interacting with AI. Further excerpts outline safety and ethics considerations (data privacy, FERPA/COPA/CIPA, bias, verification) that should be embedded into student-facing templates to ensure responsible AI use in classrooms. Collectively, these excerpts support the field value by outlining (a) guardrails and safety conventions, (b) structured-output templates for code + narrative, (c) age-appropriate prompt design, and (d) practical examples and checklists for implementing such templates in K-12 coding curricula. The highest relevance comes from excerpts that explicitly discuss structured outputs, prompt engineering practices, and K-12 AI usage guidance, followed by broader AI-in-education policy and safety guidance, then by more general AI content. The remaining excerpts provide useful context but are less central to the exact fine-grained field value (noting potential tangential examples like specific toy-POT-based prompts or turtle graphics discussions).",

Among the excerpts, the most relevant discussion touches on differentiated learning and technology, which aligns with age-based differentiation in assessment design. This is followed by items addressing assessment strategies in CS education and formative assessment practices, which provide contextual support for designing rubrics and evaluating student work in programming-related tasks. None of the excerpts directly provide the exact rubric language or the explicit age-differentiated rubric criteria described, but they collectively offer supportive background on how assessment and differentiation are approached in educational contexts. The content about formative assessment and real-time feedback also helps ground how rubrics might be used to judge evolving student outputs. Overall, the supporting evidence is partial and indirect, with no full alignment to the precise rubric specifications requested.",

One excerpt explicitly states the lesson time is 120 minutes, which directly corroborates the duration of the entire workshop session. Another excerpt notes that the entire coding workshop can be completed in just 2 hours, which is effectively the same duration expressed differently and supports the schedule's total length. A third excerpt references a base duration of 120 minutes for introductory robotics and STEM lessons, further establishing that 120-minute blocks are a common, viable length for similar curricula and unit plans. Taken together, these excerpts consistently support the notion that a 120-minute workshop schedule is feasible and aligns with the requested minute-by-minute structure. The most relevant parts are the explicit statements of 120 minutes or 2 hours, followed by the general reference to 120-minute lesson durations in related curricula, which helps validate the schedule's length and sequencing requirements.",

Additional excerpts that discuss formative assessment practices and real-time feedback support the broader context of how such a summative task could be embedded in a cohesive assessment strategy, including how to verify understanding and provide timely feedback. Another excerpt on differentiated learning offers context on adapting assessment approaches for diverse learners, which is relevant to implementing the summative task in a mixed-ability workshop.

      "reasoning": "The most relevant excerpt discusses the assessment of programming skills in a CS1 context, which aligns with evaluating peer outputs and performance in a structured feedback setting, a core goal of peer-review guidelines. It acknowledges assessment approaches for technical work, which can inform how a lightweight, structured review might be implemented for code-related tasks and explanations. The next excerpt focuses on quick checks for understanding, a form of formative feedback that parallels the \"Tell\" and \"Ask\" components by encouraging concise, observable feedback on comprehension, which is valuable for producing constructive peer feedback. The third excerpt outlines several formative assessment strategies, offering practical methods for ongoing feedback and iterative improvement, directly supporting the idea of a lightweight, iterative review process. A fourth excerpt discusses real-time assessment in teaching, which relates to giving timely feedback, an important aspect of any peer-review protocol, though it is less specific to structured peer feedback. The fifth excerpt covers differentiated learning and technology, which is less directly connected to peer-review workflows but still touches on how feedback and assessment can be personalized, a consideration for any review framework. Overall, these sources together suggest that while none explicitly define TAG-style peer feedback, they provide supportive context about assessment, feedback timing, and iterative improvement that can ground a lightweight peer-review process in educational practice.",

      "reasoning": "The most relevant content directly addresses student privacy, data handling, and legal safeguards when using AI tools in education. For example, FERPA guidance explains rights and protections around student records, which anchors how schools must treat data when deploying educational technologies. COPPA guidance is similarly central for protecting children's data in tools that collect information from students under 13, which is critical when considering a K-12 Harry Potter-themed coding workshop using an LLM tool. Model terms of service that emphasize protecting student privacy and prohibiting inappropriate data collection are also highly pertinent as they translate policy into practice for a classroom assistant scenario. General privacy considerations, such as essential questions about data privacy before AI adoption and state-level guidance, further reinforce the governance frame that underpins responsible use of AI in schools. Collectively, these excerpts map to the field value's components: risks to IP and copyright can be mitigated with disclaimers and transformative use notes, while privacy risks are mitigated through no-PII policies, vendor vetting, informed consent, and adherence to FERPA/COPPA, plus ongoing governance. The included resources also anticipate contingency planning and governance around AI use in education, aligning with the field value's mitigation strategy. Therefore, excerpts explicitly naming FERPA, COPPA, privacy policies, vendor/vetting considerations, consent, and school governance are most directly supportive; others that discuss broader AI ethics or education technology governance provide supportive context but are less directly tied to the specific mitigations listed in the field value.",

Excerpts discussing the impact and use of gamified elements like leaderboards and point systems directly relate to how such a scoring and display mechanism can influence motivation, fairness, and clarity in a classroom gamification context. Specifically, a discussion of leaderboards improving motivation and engagement supports the idea that a visible scoreboard can drive participation and sustained interest in the activity. Descriptions of implementing a house system or points-based gamification in classrooms further corroborate the feasibility and design considerations of a scoreboard-centered approach. The mentions of awarding points for performance and the existence of house-based scoring systems align with the concept of a text-only leaderboard that aggregates points and presents per-student averages for fairness. Taken together, these excerpts substantiate the rationale for using a leaderboard-based, text-rendered scoreboard and highlight considerations around fairness, motivation, and system design that are consistent with the requested field value.",

Statements about leaderboards, points, and a house-based framework directly support the notion of a House Points gamification system and its potential impact on motivation and engagement. Excerpts that address gamification more broadly (without naming House Points or a House System) still support the general idea that point-based or competitive gamified elements can influence learning, but they are less directly tied to the exact House Points framework described in the field value. In this way, the most relevant items are those that name or clearly imply House Points systems; slightly less relevant items discuss gamification mechanics in education; and the least directly relevant items provide broader context about gamification without specific House Points references.",

So, measuring the students’ effort in acquiring this amount of learning and comparing it between the two groups can provide a better assessment. Our gamified content improved students' attitude toward the statistics, which can be explained by elements used in the design. The narrative of the gamified content focused on the usefulness of the player's activity in serving and helping others positively impacted the students' attitude regarding the value of statistics and its benefits. However, since the enjoyment of the intrinsic value of the statistics was not been targeted, it did not have much impact on students’ affect.

      "reasoning": "The most directly supportive content identifies concrete implementations or mentions of a point-based or scoring system in an educational gamified context. For example, passages describing a House Points system, which assigns points for positive behaviors or successful outcomes, align with the idea of a scoring category where four areas yield points. References to leaderboards and the motivational effects of points and ranking further reinforce the notion that performance-based scoring drives engagement and feedback, which maps closely to the fine-grained field's emphasis on rewardable behaviors (e.g., successful code runs, debugging, creativity through design, and collaborative pair work). Other excerpts discuss gamification as a design approach in classrooms, including bar charts or graphs of progress and the role of points and feedback in enhancing motivation, which provides supporting context for a structured scoring scheme. A passage explicitly about using leaderboards to boost motivation and performance directly supports the concept of a public, point-driven scoring system tied to student actions. A reference to implementing a House System inspired by a real-school example adds practical grounding for a gamified points scheme in a classroom setting. An excerpt about the general idea of gamification and its mechanics helps establish terminology and concepts that underpin the scoring categories described in the field value. Finally, an excerpt that describes class-wide gamification elements and the impact of points, feedback, and dashboards provides additional evidence that such scoring structures are commonly used to motivate and assess students in a classroom context. Together, these excerpts collectively ground the notion of a four-category point-based scoring framework linked to concrete classroom behaviors and outcomes (execution, debugging, creativity, and collaboration) within a gamified environment.",

The most relevant excerpts explicitly discuss points being awarded within a house-system or gamified context, which directly supports the notion of a reward-based rubric.

Another excerpt describes implementing a house system in the classroom, which typically revolves around accumulating points for houses, embodying a reward-centric structure. Additional excerpts address leaderboards and the broader impact of gamification on motivation and engagement, which are conceptually related to how a points-based rubric might influence intrinsic motivation and classroom dynamics. Further excerpts discuss gamification in K-12 contexts and how it affects engagement and learning outcomes, supporting the broader rationale for using points and rewards as motivational levers. Finally, several excerpts provide concrete examples of implementing house systems and gamified structures in schools, which help ground the rubric in real-world practice.

            "This issue strengthens the use of students' social comparison in the design of statistics course gamification, which was not used in the present study due to technical limitations. Also, another reason for the lack of observation of gamification’s impact on learning may be that students employ all their efforts and facilities to get good grades in the evaluations in both groups. So, measuring the students’ effort in acquiring this amount of learning and comparing it between the two groups can provide a better assessment. Our gamified content improved students' attitude toward the statistics, which can be explained by elements used in the design. The narrative of the gamified content focused on the usefulness of the player's activity in serving and helping others positively impacted the students' attitude regarding the value of statistics and its benefits. However, since the enjoyment of the intrinsic value of the statistics was not been targeted, it did not have much impact on students’ affect. It seems that the elements of point, feedback and scoreboard, through promoting self-efficacy and self-confidence, affected students’ attitude toward their cognitive competency. It is similar to the Sailor, et al.’s study that badges, leaderboards, and performance graphs affect competence need satisfaction and task meaningfulness ( [24]() )."

Excerpts that address anti-bias education standards and practices provide direct alignment with these goals. For example, one excerpt discusses a structured anti-bias framework designed for K-12 education, which aligns with instituting equitable and bias-aware practices in a classroom or workshop setting. Another excerpt covers a framework for anti-bias practices across education, offering standards and domains that support culturally responsive pedagogy. A third excerpt explicitly discusses wise feedback, a concrete method to reduce bias and support student growth. Additional excerpts on self-determination theory and the effects of gamification on motivation help explain how to design fair, motivating experiences rather than biased or biased-heavy systems. Finally, discussions on the impact of leaderboards in education offer insight into balancing competitive elements with fairness and motivation.

The next most relevant excerpt provides an explicit runnable example of a bar plot, showing how a bar chart is created and labeled, which demonstrates the practical implementation of the concept in a classroom context. Following that, the excerpt describing a basic barplot using a dedicated visualization resource reinforces the core idea of constructing a bar chart to visualize category-based data and how to customize or understand it. Another excerpt reinforces the same conceptual framing by noting that a bar plot uses rectangular bars to represent data categories and that the bar length/proportion communicates category comparisons, further solidifying the linkage between the field value and the provided material. A final excerpt, which mentions this bar-plot concept with a date-inserted statement, still supports the core idea that bar plots convey categorical comparisons, albeit with less emphasis on the instructional framing for categoricals and the visualization purpose than the others. Taken together, the excerpts consistently support the idea that this module teaches about categorical data and bar charts as the primary tool for comparing categories.",

      "reasoning": "A social network diagram with clearly labeled nodes and edges corresponds to a graph with named vertices and connections. The most relevant information is content that explicitly relates to drawing or visualizing a graph made of nodes and edges, as well as examples where a graph is created, nodes are defined, and edges are added, since these operations underpin constructing and rendering a Marauder's Map-like visualization. The excerpt describing a visualization that includes a command to draw a graph with centrality measures directly aligns with the idea of rendering a network diagram of relationships. An excerpt discussing that a graph is a collection of nodes and edges provides essential context for understanding the structure of the Marauder's Map representation. Another excerpt demonstrates creating a Graph object and adding a node, which maps to the concept of individual characters as nodes. An excerpt showing how edges are added between specific nodes mirrors the explicit friendships or connections in the described diagram. Additional excerpts about a different graph example and general Graph documentation contribute contextual grounding about the NetworkX library and graph concepts, though they are less directly tied to the exact described six-node, two-cluster arrangement. Taken together, the strongest support comes from the visualization-focused and edge-definition excerpts, with supportive context from general graph-building references.",
