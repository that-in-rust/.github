Notably, it employs Mock Service Worker (MSW) to mock API requests during frontend testing, allowing for isolated and reliable UI tests. The React client uses `axios` integrated with React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) for data fetching and state management. While local development infrastructure isn't detailed, the project is configured for deployment via a CI/CD pipeline to Netlify."

The authentication flow is modern and secure, implementing the Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) flow. It uses JWT for access tokens and supports role-based access control (differentiating between 'user' and 'admin' roles) as well as social logins with providers like GitHub and Google.",
        "user_experience": "The project provides an excellent developer experience for learning security integration. It uses Docker to containerize all its dependencies, including a MongoDB database for data storage and the Keycloak server itself, making the local setup straightforward and reproducible.

It is an excellent example of moving beyond traditional REST. The backend uses the `spring-boot-starter-graphql` dependency to implement its GraphQL endpoints. Authentication is handled by integrating with Auth0, a popular identity-as-a-service provider, using the OAuth 2.0 protocol. The backend is connected to a Neo4j graph database, which is a natural and powerful choice for applications with complex, interconnected data, aligning well with GraphQL's query capabilities.",
        "user_experience": "The developer setup is streamlined using Docker and a `compose.yaml` file, which orchestrates the Neo4j database container. The project is built with a modern, type-safe stack, using Java on the backend and TypeScript on the frontend, which improves code quality and developer productivity. The setup process involves using the Auth0 CLI to configure the application, which provides a good learning experience for integrating with third-party SaaS tools."

It provides a pre-configured foundation that supports both GraphQL and REST API styles. It comes with the GraphiQL interactive playground for exploring the GraphQL API. The authentication is deeply integrated with Keycloak, providing out-of-the-box features like Single Sign-On (SSO), login/logout functionality, and an admin panel for user management, all based on OAuth2 and OpenID Connect standards.",
        "user_experience": "This boilerplate offers a superior developer experience for starting a new, secure, full-stack project. It uses Docker Compose to manage a PostgreSQL database and provides a simple shell script (`start-keycloak.sh`) to run the Keycloak instance in a Docker container.

The primary focus of this repository is to demonstrate a comprehensive Docker Compose setup for both development and production environments.",

The repository provides two separate Docker Compose files: `docker-compose.yml` for local development (likely with features like hot-reloading) and `docker-compose-prod.yml` for building and running a production-ready version of the application.

        "integrations": "This integration pattern uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for stateless authentication. The Rails API backend, often built with gems like `devise-jwt` or `knock`, is responsible for issuing a signed token upon successful login. The token is sent to the client in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header. The React client then stores this token (typically in `localStorage`) and includes it in the header of all subsequent requests to protected API endpoints. For this to work across different domains, the Rails `Rack::Cors` middleware must be configured to expose the `Authorization` header, allowing the client-side JavaScript to read the token from the response.",
        "tests_and_performance": "This approach is well-suited for decoupled architectures where the frontend and backend are deployed separately (e.g., Rails API on Heroku, React SPA on Netlify/Vercel). Since it's stateless, it can simplify server-side scaling. CSRF protection is not typically required for this pattern because authentication is not based on cookies. Testing involves verifying that the API correctly issues and validates tokens and that the client correctly attaches them to requests. Example repositories like `learn-co-curriculum/react-hooks-auth-jwt` and `coderhs/rails-api-only-devise-jwt-example-app` provide practical implementations."
      },
      {
        "integrations": "This pattern uses Rails' traditional stateful session and cookie mechanism for authentication, which is often considered more secure against XSS attacks than storing JWTs in `localStorage`. For an API-only Rails app, this requires re-enabling `ActionDispatch::Cookies` and `ActionDispatch::Session::CookieStore` middleware. A critical part of this pattern is handling Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The Rails backend must be configured with `protect_from_forgery` and send a CSRF token to the client, often via a cookie (`X-CSRF-Token`). The React client, using a library like `axios` with `withCredentials: true`, must then read this token and include it in the `X-CSRF-Token` header for all non-GET requests.",
        "tests_and_performance": "This pattern is highly effective when the frontend and backend are served from the same domain or in a monorepo deployment. For cross-domain setups, the `Rack::Cors` configuration must be set with `credentials: true` and a specific origin. Session cookies should be configured with `secure: true` and `same_site: :strict` in production for enhanced security. Deployment can be done as a monorepo to Heroku, where a `heroku-postbuild` script builds the React app and serves its static assets from the Rails `public` directory. Guides like 'Deploying a Rails API/React App with Sessions and CSRF Tokens' provide detailed walkthroughs."
      },
      {
        "integrations": "This pattern involves containerizing both the Rails API and the React frontend using Docker and orchestrating them with Docker Compose. A common setup includes three services: `backend` (Rails), `frontend` (React), and `db` (e.g., PostgreSQL). A reverse proxy, typically Nginx, is used as a fourth service to route incoming traffic. For example, requests to `/api` are forwarded to the Rails service, while all other requests are sent to the React service. This setup effectively mimics a production environment and handles CORS issues at the proxy level.",
        "tests_and_performance": "Dockerized deployment provides a highly consistent and reproducible environment for both development and production, which is a significant advantage for developer experience and operational stability. The `docker-compose.yml` file defines the entire application stack, making it easy to spin up with a single command. This pattern is flexible and can be deployed to any cloud provider that supports Docker containers. Repositories like `willcodeforcoffee/docker-rails-react` and `adaam2/docker-rails-react-starter` serve as excellent starter kits, providing pre-configured `docker-compose.yml` and Nginx files."

      {
        "integrations": "This pattern involves deploying the Rails API and React frontend as a single unit within a monorepo, typically to a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) like Heroku. The React application is treated as a build-time dependency of the Rails application. A `heroku-postbuild` script in the root `package.json` handles building the React app, and the resulting static assets (HTML, CSS, JS) are copied into the Rails `public/` directory. A catch-all 'fallback' route is added to `config/routes.rb` to serve the `public/index.html` for any non-API request, allowing React Router to take over client-side navigation.",
        "tests_and_performance": "This is a popular and cost-effective deployment strategy, especially for smaller projects and portfolio pieces. It simplifies the deployment process by managing only one application instance. Performance is generally good, as the frontend assets are served statically by Rails. The setup requires using both the `heroku/nodejs` and `heroku/ruby` buildpacks. A `Procfile` is used to define the web process (running the Rails server) and a release process for database migrations. The HackMD article 'Rails/React Monorepo Heroku Deployment' provides a canonical guide for this setup."

This aligns with the claim that architecture-centric tutorials and exemplars are valuable for building a strong, idiomatic backend foundation.\n\nFor Ruby on Rails, excerpts describing Rails-focused open-source examples, Rails security/architecture discussions, and Rails-based e-commerce platforms illustrate idiomatic Rails patterns and real-world Rails projects, which supports the executive_summary's goal of including Rails-oriented learning exemplars and patterns. The Rails-related excerpts anchor the portfolio-building aspect by pointing to representative Rails apps (e.g., Rails RealWorld variants and Rails-based e-commerce platforms) that learners can study and contribute to.\n\nA separate excerpt highlights a TypeScript/Redux-React-RealWorld variant in a full-stack RealWorld example app (React + TypeScript + Redux), which strengthens the executive_summary's claim about idiomatic React practices reinforced through realistic, end-to-end examples. The inclusion of a React-Redux-RealWorld-Example demonstrates patterns learners can emulate when building their own portfolios.\n\nOverall, these excerpts collectively justify the executive_summary's structure: real-world learning exemplars (RealWorld across React/Redux and other stacks), architecture-focused guidance for Spring (Modulith/Hexagonal/Modular Monolith), and Rails ecosystem learning examples (security, Rails patterns, and Rails-based real-world apps) form a coherent portfolio-building and idiomatic-pattern learning path. The excerpts directly support the major thesis points: (1) RealWorld-style learning apps across stacks, (2) architecture-centric Rails/Spring guidance, (3) pragmatic Rails learning apps and security practices, and (4) idiomatic React learning exemplars via RealWorld variants and other curated React resources.",

Assigning text-based code and data to `innerHTML` is a common mistake in JavaScript applications. This pattern is so dangerous that React does not expose `innerHTML` directly but encapsulates it in a property called [dangerouslySetInnerHTML](https://zhenyong.github.io/react/tips/dangerously-set-inner-html.html). Improper use of the innerHTML can open you up to a [cross-site scripting (XSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) attack."

The excerpts include multiple direct references to contributing guides and \"good first issue\" labeling, which correspond to the contribution-readiness criterion. For example, excerpts discussing CONTRIBUTING guidelines and how to contribute inline with repository health, and those enumerating beginner-friendly issues, map clearly to the evaluation criteria about ease of onboarding and community health. Additional excerpts discuss the existence of clear contribution workflows and signals of active maintenance, which align with the field's emphasis on community health signals and modern idiomatic practices. Other excerpts touch on architecture and patterns (e.g., modular monoliths, hexagonal/DDD patterns) and provide concrete examples of how teams structure and document their projects, which supports the architectural idioms criterion. Taken together, these excerpts collectively substantiate the field's asserted evaluation points and demonstrate how the search process could yield repositories that meet the stated research goals. Overall, the curated excerpts consistently align with the described evaluation framework, supporting a high-confidence mapping between the field value and the available evidence.",

Other excerpts that discuss general project descriptions without addressing contributor experience are less relevant to the fine-grained field and are deprioritized. Therefore, the most relevant pieces are those that explicitly mention documentation quality and openness to contributions, followed by items enumerating contributor guidelines, good-first-issues, and explicit calls for community engagement.

Some excerpts discuss Rails in broader contexts (e.g., Rails security, deployment, or general Rails guides). While those are valuable context, they are less tightly coupled to the concept of curated Rails learning exemplars or tutorial-friendly Rails resources, and thus are placed lower in relevance. Overall, the best-supported claims come from excerpts that clearly present Rails learning exemplars and tutorial-friendly Rails resources, with strong alignment to the field's intent.

It explains issuing a signed JWT from the Rails backend, sending it to the client in the Authorization header, storing the token on the client, and including it in subsequent requests, with necessary CORS considerations. This directly aligns with the first integration style in the field value. Additional excerpts describe Rails API-only backends using JWT (often with gems like devise-jwt or knock) and React clients that attach the token to requests, which reinforces the JWT-based integration narrative and provides concrete implementation cues. Content that discusses how CSRF protection interacts with token-based vs. cookie-based approaches clarifies the security posture: stateless JWT authentication typically reduces reliance on CSRF, while cookie-based sessions require explicit CSRF handling and token propagation in headers for non-GET requests. This matches the second integration style in the field value, where a stateful session and cookies are used, and CSRF becomes central to securing cross-site requests. The excerpt about deploying Rails + React in a monorepo or Dockerized setup demonstrates the third integration style: a combined deployment where Rails and React are co-managed (e.g., via a docker-compose.yml, a Rails server with a separate frontend, or a single monorepo with postbuild steps) and served together, which maps to the monorepo/deployment pattern in the field. Specifically, one excerpt shows a JWT/Rails API + React example, another set discusses Rails API with Devise/JWT and Rails API-only patterns, while others detail cookie-based CSRF handling in a Rails/React setup, and finally several excerpts describe dockerized, monorepo-style deployments pairing Rails and React. Collectively these excerpts provide a coherent mapping to the three integration approaches in the field value and supply concrete guidance for implementation and testing in a full-stack React + Rails context.",

The nearby items reiterate the same theme, reinforcing that these exemplars serve as concrete references for testing strategies in real projects.\n\nAdditionally, excerpts describing Microcks API lifecycle with Spring Boot order service show how testcontainers-based integration testing is used to bring real dependencies into tests. This aligns with exemplar-style testing patterns for backend services and integration tests, illustrating a canonical approach to testing in a microservices context. This complements Cypress-driven exemplars by showing how testing pragmatics extend beyond the frontend to full-stack integration scenarios, which is a key facet of testing strategy exemplars across stacks.\n\nFurther supporting evidence comes from excerpts detailing testcontainers-based back-end testing, including the use of JUnit 5 extensions and ServiceConnection-like patterns for seamless test setup. These exemplify mature backend testing patterns that are commonly cited in testing exemplars for Java/Spring ecosystems, reinforcing the field value's emphasis on cross-framework exemplar testing strategies.\n\nFinally, an excerpt highlights code coverage reporting for a real-world app, including steps to generate and view coverage reports. This directly supports the component of the field value related to coverage instrumentation as part of testing exemplars.\n\nIn summary, excerpts that explicitly describe Cypress-based testing exemplars for frontend, coupled with backend/test-container exemplars and coverage reporting workflows, most strongly support the fine-grained field value. Excerpts focusing on coverage reports and flaky-test mitigation likewise align with the exemplar spirit of well-documented testing strategies across environments.

      "reasoning": "- The most directly relevant excerpts are official documentation and examples describing multitenancy in Spring Security: they explain resolving tenants by the issuer claim using a JwtIssuerAuthenticationManagerResolver, and outline tenant-specific validators. This aligns closely with the first mechanism in the fine-grained value, which describes a Spring Boot starter that uses the JWT issuer (iss) claim to resolve tenants and applies tenant-specific validation. The cited passages explicitly discuss JWT-based tenant resolution and per-tenant validators, which map cleanly to the described mechanism and its operational pattern.\n- The next strongest matches discuss concrete multitenancy strategies in Spring (e.g., database-per-tenant, schema-per-tenant, and shared-database-with-discriminator patterns). These excerpts describe the different tenancy models and how they are implemented or illustrated (e.g., separate branches for distinct tenancy strategies and the use of a discriminator or row-level security). This maps to the second mechanism in the field value, which enumerates multiple Hibernate-based tenancy approaches and clarifies their contexts, making them highly relevant as architectural reference material.\n- For identity-provider integrations, an excerpt describing a real Okta sample (Okta Spring Boot Starter) is highly relevant to the third mechanism described in the field value. It provides explicit steps for configuring an OpenID Connect flow and securing a Spring Boot API with an external IdP, which is a practical exemplar of identity-provider-backed authentication in a multi-tenant context.\n- Excerpts covering Keycloak-based tenancy (e.g., a realm-based tenancy model with a dynamic Keycloak config resolver) map to the fourth mechanism in the field value. These passages describe dynamic tenant resolution with Keycloak configuration and are a precise fit for real-world tenancy with an IAM provider.\n- The fifth mechanism concerns the DB-based tenancy approach (database-per-tenant) implemented via a request interceptor and Hibernate's CurrentTenantIdentifierResolver. Excerpts that explicitly describe such an interceptor approach and dynamic data source switching match this mechanism well, providing concrete learning materials for implementing per-tenant databases and dynamic DS switching.\n- Overall, the first three items in the field value receive the strongest direct support from the excerpts. The later items (Keycloak-based tenancy, database-per-tenant interceptor approach) are well-supported by multiple excerpts that describe those patterns, albeit sometimes in adjacent or companion-docs form (blog posts, companion repositories). The confidence reflects how tightly the excerpts' content can be mapped to each mechanism, with higher confidence for clearly described patterns and slightly lower for more auxiliary discussions.",

      "reasoning": "- The Apollo Client overview explains that Apollo Client is a comprehensive GraphQL state management tool for JavaScript/TypeScript React apps, which aligns with the learning opportunity of mastering an industry-leading GraphQL client and its patterns such as caching, UI state, and error handling. This directly supports the idea of using Apollo for advanced GraphQL concepts in React. - The cursor-based pagination documentation for Apollo GraphQL provides a concrete pattern for paginating GraphQL results, which is a core advanced technique for building scalable client apps. This supports the learning opportunity around advanced data fetching strategies in GraphQL with React. - A focused excerpt about Apollo- related discussions on optimistic UI updates helps illustrate how to distinguish optimistic results from server results, a critical concept for building responsive UIs in GraphQL clients. This ties to advanced UI correctness and state management in Apollo-based apps. - The Apollo-specific pagination/relay-related resource (FleekHQ/apollo-cursor-pagination or related discussion) reinforces practical pagination techniques in Apollo, complementing the core pagination concept. - The Relay pagination container docs demonstrate how to implement pagination in a React-Relay setup, highlighting a different GraphQL client approach (Relay) and its patterns, useful for comparative study of GraphQL clients in React ecosystems. - RealWorld-React exemplars (GothThinkster RealWorld variants and similar Redux+TS+React RealWorld instances) serve as concrete, end-to-end full-stack React patterns that resemble the learning opportunities of building production-like RealWorld apps, including authentication, routing, and data fetching. - The RealWorld-Redux-Toolkit example (React+Redux Toolkit) provides another concrete variant of a full-stack RealWorld-style app with React on the frontend, reinforcing practical architectures and integration with modern React tooling. - Additional RealWorld-React-centric notes and examples illustrate how to map the RealWorld API to real projects, relevant for portfolio-building and hands-on practice. - The additional RealWorld/React entries supplement the core trio of Apollo examples and Relay patterns with broader RealWorld-React learning contexts, including practical frontend/backend integration patterns. - The combination of these excerpts covers the requested learning opportunities: GraphQL clients (Apollo, Relay), real-time/streaming patterns (WebSockets, SSE), and RealWorld full-stack exemplars in React ecosystems, aligning with the described learning opportunities and stacking patterns.",

While these excerpts focus on React, the overall executive summary aims to cover React, Spring Boot, and Ruby on Rails; the excerpts do not provide direct evidence for Spring Boot or Rails projects, but they richly support the React portion of the overview and illustrate the kind of idiomatic, scalable code and architectural patterns the overview intends to highlight.

This directly supports the first item in the target field value as a premier front-end example built on React in a large production system.\n- The Guardian dotscom rendering piece reinforces the production-grade React frontend focus: it describes the Guardian's rendering stack with React in a monorepo setup, serving content at scale. This aligns with the field value's emphasis on large, production-grade React frontends and patterns in a real-world media context.\n- Grafana entries showcase the Grafana frontend ecosystem, emphasizing a data-heavy React UI, a dedicated component library (grafana-ui), and a production-grade dashboard environment. This maps to the field value's use case of building robust, scalable React UIs for observability and dashboards.\n- PostHog excerpts describe a React-based frontend for a product analytics platform, illustrating complex, production-grade React apps with a data-rich UI, tying directly to the use case of building and presenting real-world dashboards and analytics interfaces with React.\n- Outline is a real-time, full-stack React/Node knowledge base frontend/backend example. This supplies a concrete production-grade React app example that demonstrates real-time collaboration and frontend-backend integration patterns suitable for portfolio demonstration.\n- Sentry frontend excerpts reference a large React/TypeScript frontend within a SaaS product, including a sophisticated testing and UI setup (emotion styling, etc.). This aligns with the field value's production-grade React frontends and the complexity of modern SaaS frontends.\n- BBC Simorgh and Guardian entries (as noted) together establish a pattern of production-grade, large-scale React frontends used by major media organizations, reinforcing the field's emphasis on real-world, idiomatic React at scale.\n- Grafana UI package and related Grafana frontend references provide concrete examples of a modern React UI ecosystem, including component libraries and enterprise-grade UI patterns, which supports the field's focus on idiomatic React patterns in large apps.\n- PostHog's React-centric documentation and JS packages reinforce the production-grade React frontend use-case, particularly for analytics dashboards and event-driven UIs.\n- The remaining entries (Outline, Guardian, BBC Simorgh, Guardian render service, Grafana, PostHog) collectively corroborate a set of strong production-grade React examples with real-world stack details, patterns (SSR/CSR, monorepos, dashboards, testing stacks like Jest/Cypress), and meaningful portfolios for a developer transitioning to frontend leadership roles.\n\nOverall, the most relevant excerpts directly describe production-grade React frontends in large-scale, real-world projects (BBC Simorgh, Guardian render service, Grafana, PostHog, Outline, Sentry), followed by supportive context about related front-end ecosystems and testing practices that exemplify idiomatic React usage in production.",

This allows the\nbrowser to verify that the script has not been tampered with and prevent [\"man in the middle\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) attacks.",
            "Sanitizing HTML\n---------------\n\nReal-world applications often run into requirements where they need to render dynamic HTML code. Assigning text-based code and data to `innerHTML` is a common mistake in JavaScript applications. This pattern is so dangerous that React does not expose `innerHTML` directly but encapsulates it in a property called [dangerouslySetInnerHTML](https://zhenyong.github.io/react/tips/dangerously-set-inner-html.html). Improper use of the innerHTML can open you up to a [cross-site scripting (XSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) attack.",

This aligns with the CSP/SRI aspects of the field value.

To support these points, the most directly relevant excerpts establish both the platform identity and its marketplace/ecommerce scope: a Rails-based, feature-rich ecommerce solution (Solidus) is described as a complete open-source ecommerce platform built on Rails, which aligns with the idea of an enterprise-grade, highly capable ecommerce stack. This same cluster of excerpts also identifies Spree as a Rails-based ecommerce platform, which is a foundational Rails ecommerce solution commonly used for multi-store and multi-vendor configurations. In addition, Open Food Network is presented as a Rails-based marketplace targeting local food systems, with tenancy and Stripe-like payment considerations, which lines up with a community/local-marketplace use case. Sharetribe Go is referenced as a multi-vendor marketplace platform, illustrating the marketplace-specific focus within Rails ecosystems. The excerpts collectively map to the field value by naming each platform and describing its marketplace/ecommerce scope and capabilities (multi-store, multi-vendor, payments integration, etc.). Specifically: - Solidus is called out as \"a complete open source e-commerce solution built with Ruby on Rails,\" underscoring its role as a broad, feature-rich Rails ecommerce stack. - Spree is referenced as a Rails-based ecommerce platform, illustrating a core Rails ecommerce solution suitable for building marketplaces. - Open Food Network is described as a Rails-based marketplace with documented data models for multi-store/tenant configurations and payment integration, aligning with the field's focus on marketplaces with tenancy and payments. - Sharetribe Go is highlighted for its multi-vendor marketplace design, demonstrating the marketplace-centric Rails ecosystem. - Additional excerpts discuss related Rails ecommerce contexts (e.g., Solidus/Solidus Multi Domain, Open Food Network schemas with Spree Tables) that reinforce the multi-tenant and multi-vendor facets in Rails ecommerce. Taken together, these excerpts provide direct support for the field value's four components: a Rails ecommerce platform with broad capabilities, an enterprise-leaning fork for customization, a multi-vendor marketplace solution, and a Rails-based marketplace focused on local-food ecosystems with tenancy considerations.",

Excerpts describing Spring Boot's Contribute Page and stating that the repository doesn't have good first issues indicate weak entry points for new contributors, which aligns with a lack of community support for onboarding and guidance. Likewise, notes about contributing guidelines and the need to contend with automated procedures (such as Signed-off-by requirements) illuminate the friction points that can deter community participation, supporting the notion of weaker community support. Conversely, excerpts that describe welcoming contributors and active community engagement provide contrast to the field value but are less aligned with the requested false community_support signal; they are still relevant for context about how other projects prioritize developer experience. Specifically, the passages mentioning: - a contribute page for Spring Boot urging first contributions but acknowledging availability of only some issues or steps to start, suggesting suboptimal onboarding; - guidance around CONTRIBUTING.adoc, DCO requirements, and the process to contribute, which are factors in onboarding difficulty; - statements that the project is welcoming and well-documented (as a contrast) help delineate what would be true if community support were high. Extracted quotes about contribution guidelines, first issues, and DCO are the strongest evidence for a weak onboarding/community path. Quotes about welcoming contributors illustrate a different reality and thus are less supportive of the requested field value, though still informative for overall developer experience context.",

For example, passages that outline contributing guidelines, onboarding, and 'good first issue' labeling map directly to community health and contribution readiness, which are core to a developer's learning path and portfolio building. References that emphasize architectural idioms and modern practices (such as Hexagonal Architecture, DDD, clean architecture, and the use of modern features like App Router or server components) align with the criterion of assessing architectural patterns and idiomatic usage. Passages that discuss real-world relevance and portfolio-worthy projects provide direct alignment with the portfolio-building and project-selection criteria. Practical DX topics like Docker, clear READMEs, and onboarding docs support the developer experience criterion. References to specific frameworks' modern practices (Spring Boot 3.x, Next.js 13+ App Router, Rails Hotwire) illustrate concrete examples of up-to-date idiomatic usage. Some excerpts are more tutorial- or guide-oriented rather than evaluative about repository quality, so they provide necessary context but are somewhat less tightly tied to the evaluation framework than the ones focusing on contribution readiness, architectural practices, and portfolio relevance.",

Excerpts that discuss setting up session cookies in a Rails API with JavaScript front ends directly support this pattern by detailing the placement and handling of cookies, CSRF tokens, and the necessary Rails controller and middleware configuration. Additional excerpts that address Rack CORS configuration, origins, and secure cookie deployment further support the context of deploying a Rails API with session-based authentication in real-world apps. Excerpts that focus on JWT-based authentication or non-Rails stacks are less relevant but may provide contrast or adjacent considerations. See passages that describe: (a) Rails API with session cookies and the CSRF-token workflow, (b) Rack::Cors and credentials for cross-origin requests, and (c) deployment considerations for monorepos or secure cookie settings. Together, these form a coherent set of evidence for the alleged pattern being analyzed, with the most direct relevance from explicit Rails API + session cookie configurations and CSRF handling, followed by cross-origin and deployment considerations that affect how the pattern is implemented in practice.",

The most relevant excerpts explicitly discuss Rails API authentication using JWT (via gems like devise-jwt or knock) and how the React client interacts with the token, including how the client stores the token and sends it in the Authorization header. They also cover configuring CORS to expose the Authorization header, which is essential for cross-origin JWT usage. Other excerpts discuss Rails API authentication with Devise and JWT, Knock, and general Rails API authentication approaches, including JWT, as well as CORS-related setup and CSRF considerations. These collectively map directly to the implied integration pattern, including token issuance, client storage, header-based authorization, and cross-origin access rules. The non-Rails JWT excerpts touch on JWT in React/SpringBoot contexts, which are related to the broader JWT pattern but do not directly support the Rails+React integration specifics, so they are considered less central. The presence of multiple Rails-specific JWT implementations and clear CORS guidance across the excerpts strongly supports the described field value and its components (token issuance, Authorization header usage, and cross-origin exposure). The discussion of CSRF handling and session-based cookies in Rails API contexts provides useful context but is secondary to the core JWT-based, header-auth approach called out in the field value. Overall, there is strong alignment between the field value and the identified excerpts, with multiple, direct mentions of Rails API JWT flows and CORS considerations.",

This supports the notion that there are example implementations or patterns around CycloneDX BOMs in open-source projects, which can underpin the claim about SBOM generation and standard usage. While the excerpt does not mention Spring Boot, Actuator, or an explicit SBOM endpoint, it still provides concrete linkage to CycloneDX-based BOM generation concepts that are relevant to the fine-grained field value. Therefore, at least partial support is present for the field value, especially in demonstrating the feasibility and context of using CycloneDX SBOMs in OSS projects.",

One excerpt outlines a Next.js SaaS starter with features such as authentication (JWT-based), RBAC, Stripe for billing, Postgres with a type-safe ORM (Drizzle), and server-actions-oriented architecture, which maps precisely to the field value's first repo description. Additional excerpts expand on the same starter family, detailing server actions, deployment to hosting like Vercel, and the minimal yet complete feature set that supports rapid production deployment—these reinforce both the idiomatic use of Next.js patterns and production readiness claim. Another excerpt highlights Clerk for authentication (instead of or alongside NextAuth), multi-tenancy with team management, Drizzle ORM, and end-to-end type-safe APIs with tRPC, plus a strong emphasis on observability and developer experience. This aligns with the field value's second repo archetype, which emphasizes enterprise features (multi-tenancy, RBAC, multiple auth options, observability, CI/CD, and a robust dev environment). A third relevant excerpt notes Next.js SaaS Starter usage of NextAuth.js for authentication, Postgres, Stripe, and a Docker/DevOps-friendly setup, which supports the field value's claim of production-readiness and enterprise-grade tooling (observability, deployment guidance, etc.). Collectively, these excerpts substantiate the field value's claims about idiomatic Next.js SaaS patterns, authentication schemes, database/ORM choices, multi-tenant/RBAC capabilities, Stripe billing, and strong production-readiness signals, including deployment guidance and developer experience signals. The excerpts whose content centers on Next.js SaaS starters with Stripe, Postgres, Drizzle, and NextAuth/Clerk-LSS patterns provide the strongest, most direct support for the field value's three described repos.

Excerpts that discuss Clean Architecture in Spring Boot provide a direct link to the architectural discipline and module separation. Excerpt describing a Clean Architecture implementation in Spring Boot aligns with the notion of a multi-module, layered separation. Excerpts detailing multi-module or modular monolith approaches in Spring (such as a multi-module monolith and modular applications with Spring Boot) illustrate the practical realization of separation of concerns across modules, which supports the claim of a structured, modular build and architecture. Excerpt discussing modular monoliths with DDD and Spring Modulith also supports the idea of separating concerns into distinct modules, albeit with a focus on domain-driven design and modular structure. Taken together, these excerpts collectively support the notion of a disciplined, multi-module architecture with clear boundaries between application, domain, and infrastructure, and they imply an environment where architectural tests and separation-of-concerns are emphasized, even if not all excerpts explicitly mention ArchUnit. The most directly aligned content is the piece that explicitly references Clean Architecture in a Spring Boot context, followed by pieces that discuss multi-module or modular monolith patterns, and then broader modular architecture discussions within Spring ecosystem.",

Excerpt describing a 'domain-driven hexagon' approach directly touches the Hexagonal architecture concept and DDD, aligning with the field's emphasis on architectural style and domain boundaries.

Excerpts that discuss dynamic tenants, or multi-tenancy implemented via issuer/claim-based tenant differentiation and lazy/dynamic resolution, directly relate to this mechanism. The strongest alignment comes from the explicit section on Dynamic Tenants, which indicates a feature to handle tenants without restarting the application, i.e., dynamic tenant provisioning. Supporting alignment is found in passages that describe differentiating tenants by the issuer claim, and using a resolver (such as a JwtIssuerAuthenticationManagerResolver) to map requests to tenant configurations at runtime. Additional helpful context appears in notes about lazy loading of issuer endpoints, and about not requiring application restarts when new tenants are added, which coherently map to a dynamic, per-tenant configuration approach. Therefore, excerpts describing dynamic tenants, issuer-based tenant differentiation, and lazy/dynamic resolution provide the most direct support for the described Keycloak-based, realm-aware multi-tenancy pattern, followed by excerpts that generally discuss multi-tenancy in the OAuth2 resource-server context, and finally a related but less direct excerpt about an Okta Spring Boot starter.

This complements the hardening narrative by illustrating common pitfalls to avoid to reduce the attack surface. The third excerpt, while not addressing hardening directly, shows repository activity related to security-related workflow changes, which can be seen as contextual support indicating ongoing security considerations in related CRA projects.

The second excerpt discusses large React apps used as best-practices references for end-to-end testing with Cypress and mentions an out-of-the-box testing setup, along with a React frontend and Express backend, which aligns with the described full-stack Cypress teaching paradigm and provides additional corroborating context about Cypress-centered testing practices in real-world apps. Together, these excerpts substantiate the emphasis on Cypress testing across the front-end (React) and back-end (Express) layers and reinforce the idea of a project designed to illustrate broad testing coverage in a full-stack environment.",

The next most relevant excerpts describe Spring Boot + React with JWT authentication tutorials, which further connects to modern secure full-stack patterns, including token-based schemes that are common in OAuth2 workflows. The remaining excerpts describe general full-stack Spring Boot + React integrations or project collections that include Spring Boot + React examples, which provide context on how such stacks are commonly implemented but do not confirm the presence of GraphQL, Neo4j, or Auth0 in the specific paired repository. Overall, while there is partial alignment with the stack concept and authentication patterns, there is no direct evidence in any excerpt for the exact GraphQL backend, Neo4j graph database, or Auth0 integration claimed in the field value.

Content that discusses how to contribute, where to find issues labeled for newcomers, and how to get started with a repository provides clear alignment with a developer-focused exposure to open-source projects.

The presence of a raw schema file path (db/schema.rb) in these excerpts further supports that OFN employs a Rails-style database schema with Spree table integrations, which is evidence of domain-specific modeling for food commerce. While these excerpts confirm the architectural pattern (Rails + Spree tables) and a schema-centric approach, they do not provide direct information about Stripe payment coverage or tenancy. Therefore, they partially support the claim about domain-specific modeling and Rails-based schema, but do not substantiate the specific points about payment integration or tenancy beyond the implication of a structured schema footprint. Other excerpts discuss Spree, Solidus, and general Rails eCommerce concepts, which provide context but do not directly substantiate the OFN-specific domain modeling claim.

The accompanying notes about modularity and a robust core feature set further corroborate the claim that the platform is designed with extensibility and a broad feature set in mind, including store-level configurations and internationalization considerations. Additional excerpts reinforce that this is a Rails-based, open-source e-commerce solution with a focus on customization and flexibility, which underpins both the API-first posture and the ability to configure for various business models. Supporting evidence from broader descriptions of Rails-oriented e-commerce platforms reinforces the context that these projects are designed to be adaptable and feature-rich, including modules for promotions, cart functionality, and multi-language/currency support. Together, these excerpts align with the stated field values by illustrating: (a) a Rails-based e-commerce platform capable of supporting multi-vendor marketplaces, (b) modular architecture and a comprehensive feature set including core e-commerce concepts, and (c) emphasis on configurability and extensibility.",

However, none of the excerpts explicitly states a boolean value about the presence of guidance (i.e., they do not say \"guidance is True\" or \"guidance is False\"). Therefore, while the excerpts collectively suggest that there is instructional content and learning-oriented structure, they do not provide definitive evidence to positively confirm the field value as True.

Other excerpts contribute supportive context about educational Rails resources: one excerpt discusses Lobsters as learning exemplars and patterns with emphasis on teaching through example code, and another notes that Lobsters is a volunteer project with a focus on learning rather than production-scale complexity, which suggests an educational slant. Additional excerpts mention full-stack Rails + React setups and mono-repo guidance, which are relevant to learning and practicing full-stack patterns in Rails environments, even if not explicitly framed as tutorials. There is also mention of Ruby For Good and Rails projects that reflect real-world Rails usage, which supports the notion of learning-by-example in open-source Rails projects. Taken together, these excerpts build a coherent picture of multiple Rails repositories that are oriented toward teaching and learning through examples, tutorials, and exemplar patterns, with RailsApps being the clearest instance of a tutorial-friendly resource and the Lobsters-related excerpts enriching the educational context.

One excerpt demonstrates setting up a CSRF cookie in the application controller and enabling cookies in a Rails API context, including a method to set a CSRF token in a cookie and the use of protect_from_forgery. This directly maps to the described requirement that the backend must expose a CSRF token (often via a cookie like X-CSRF-Token) and that the client (React) should read this token and include it in the X-CSRF-Token header for non-GET requests. Another excerpt notes the use of Rails session cookies for API authentication, which aligns with a traditional stateful session approach rather than a purely JWT-based strategy. Additional excerpts discuss enabling and configuring CORS and related considerations, which are relevant for the API-client interaction pattern but are ancillary to the core CSRF/cookie mechanism. A few excerpts center on JWT-based authentication patterns, which are less aligned with the specific stateful, cookie-based approach described, but still provide broader context on authentication strategies in Rails apps. Taken together, the strongest support comes from explicit CSRF token handling via cookies, and the explicit use of a session/cookie-based authentication pattern in Rails for API contexts, with supporting context on middleware and client-side usage.",

While these latter excerpts don't explicitly enumerate multi-vendor features, they corroborate the Rails foundation and the extensibility of these platforms for marketplace-type functionality, supporting the general plausibility of building multi-vendor marketplaces with these tools.

Other excerpts discuss related architectural styles and patterns (DDD, modular/monolith architectures, and Spring Modulith) and thus provide contextual evidence about prevalent architectural practices in the space, but they do not explicitly confirm the combination of Hexagonal Architecture with CQRS, Kotlin, and ADTs.

Overall, the information supports the field value at a high level (DDD + Hexagonal patterns in a Kotlin context is plausible in projects like these) but does not provide exact confirmation of the Kotlin/CQRS/ADTs specifics.

A third excerpt references Server Components and the new App Router ecosystem in Next.js, which further corroborates the pattern of leveraging server-rendered components to manage data fetching while acknowledging the existence of server and client boundaries. Additional excerpts touch on topics like the App Router and server components in real-world projects, which provides contextual support for adopting this architectural approach in practice. While one excerpt deals with migration guides and another with error notes, these do not contradict the architectural pattern and still provide situational context for how data fetching patterns are applied within this framework.

This directly supports a structured upgrade path: (a) update Java to a supported version (e.g., Java 17+), (b) upgrade framework dependencies to Spring Framework 6.x and compatible Spring Boot 3.x artifacts, (c) adjust build configuration and dependencies accordingly, and (d) adapt codebase to Jakarta packaging and new Servlet/JPA specifications. The migration guide excerpts reinforce the need to align Maven/Gradle files with new artifact versions and to replace javax with jakarta namespaces, which are concrete steps in a structured upgrade. Additional notes about Servlet/JPA changes and the Jakarta transition further underpin a phased, dependency-focused upgrade trajectory. An explicit mention of a tool like spring-boot-properties-migrator is not found in these excerpts, so while the overall upgrade strategy is well-supported, the exact tooling recommendation cannot be confirmed here and thus remains an inferred element rather than a directly evidenced claim.",

Excerpts that describe modular monoliths and modular architectures, with an emphasis on organizing code into modules driven by domain boundaries, also support the notion that architecture should reflect business concepts rather than being purely layered or technology-driven. Related content about Clean Architecture and Spring Modulith, while thematically adjacent and useful for understanding how to structure Spring applications, provides less direct evidence about domain-reflective packaging and may serve as contextual support rather than primary evidence. In sum, the material that directly couples domain-driven design or hexagonal thinking with modular, domain-oriented organization most strongly supports the field value; broader modularity discussions provide supportive context and illustrate practical patterns in Spring ecosystems.",

That excerpt contributes context about how the Rails API and React frontend interact in a deployment scenario. A second excerpt discusses a React + Rails/JWT authentication integration pattern, which is relevant to the idea of building a full-stack with separate frontend and backend components that need to securely communicate, a relationship that Docker/Compose would facilitate. A third excerpt explicitly references a React + Spring Boot JWT example, which, while not Rails, demonstrates the broader pattern of coupling frontend and API backends with security concerns in a microservice-ish setup, reinforcing the relevance of multi-component integration in a production-like environment. Additional excerpts cover configuration and security aspects such as CORS and session cookies in Rails APIs with JavaScript frontends, which are the kinds of cross-service concerns typically addressed by a reverse proxy layer in a containerized stack. Later excerpts discuss Rails API-only apps with Devise/JWT and JWT authentication patterns, which remain within the same domain of frontend-backend integration and authentication, again tangentially supportive of a full-stack pattern. Finally, several excerpts cover general React monorepo setups and typical frontend-backend integration patterns, providing contextual support for how a frontend and backend might be organized, though without Docker specifics. Overall, none of the excerpts explicitly describe the exact Docker Compose multi-service pattern with backend, frontend, db, and Nginx, but they collectively reinforce the components and concerns that such a pattern would address (deployment, routing, CORS, JWT auth, Rails+React integration).",

A repository that showcases a modular monolith with Spring Modulith and DDD demonstrates how to structure the codebase to enable isolated bounded contexts within a single deployed artifact, directly supporting the stated adaptability claim. Additional entries discuss modular applications with Spring Boot, which reinforces the concept of modular separation within a single deployable unit and provides concrete guidance on organizing modules to improve maintainability and future decomposition. Content focusing on Clean Architecture with Spring Boot offers a architectural discipline that also promotes adaptability through separation of concerns, even if not explicitly framed around monoliths, thus supporting the underlying claim of adaptable architecture. Other entries that discuss introducing or using Spring Modulith to realize modular monoliths further corroborate the practical viability of bounded contexts and modular decomposition, reinforcing the adaptability narrative. Excerpts mentioning domain-driven design in modular contexts provide design rationale for separating concerns and aligning modules with business domains, which underpins the ability to decompose the system later. In sum, the strongest support comes from explicit modular-monolith demonstrations and tooling, followed by broader modularity discussions and architectural patterns that promote adaptability; weaker support comes from more general or tangential mentions that do not tightly connect to the monolith-with-bounded-contexts metaphor.",

References that explicitly discuss multi-tenancy as a concept and those emphasizing tenant differentiation by claims/issuer provide strong partial support for the field value, even if Keycloak is not named directly.

The most relevant excerpts are those that explicitly refer to the official documentation and how the Spring Security OAuth2 Resource Server multitenancy topic is documented there, since they directly support the claim that documentation (and the official docs) are the primary sources for guidance. Phrases like official documentation and the documentation surface for the multitenancy feature indicate that this starter library would lean on that authoritative source for their usage patterns and examples. Additional excerpts that discuss resolving tenants by claim, dynamic tenants, and deployment considerations further reinforce how the documentation presents practical usage patterns and considerations that would be reflected in a starter library's README or onboarding guidance. Excerpts that mention specific documentation sections, such as resolving the tenant by claim, the lazy loading of issuer endpoints, and the idea of multi-tenancy concepts, align with the notion that the primary docs shape how a user would adopt and configure the starter. While there is a mention in the request that the README is a primary entry point, the closest alignment to that claim is captured by excerpts that reference official documentation and its contents. An excerpt referencing the Okta Spring Boot Starter is tangential to the claim about the primary documentation and ease of use, thus it is less central to the stated finegrained value but still contextually relevant as a related starter project. In short, the strongest support comes from statements that tie the project to official documentation for its guidance, with the README serving as an onboarding gateway, and the described ease of use aligning with the notion of a simple configuration toggle presented in those docs. The less central items provide auxiliary context about tenancy concepts and related tooling that would appear alongside the primary docs and README in practice.",

For example, a list titled 'Most Loved Ruby on Rails Open Source Projects' explicitly centers on prominent Rails projects, providing concrete names (such as Discourse, Spree, Refinery CMS, and others) that are representative of large, real-world Rails codebases and architectures. This supports understanding of typical Rails project structures and how such apps are organized in the wild. Additionally, a presentation of 'Open-Source Ruby and Rails Apps' highlights a major Rails e-commerce platform with a modern UX, REST API, and GraphQL, illustrating Rails in a contemporary, production-ready context with API layers and integrations, which informs idiomatic Rails practices and potential architectural decisions. Other excerpts reference well-known Rails contenders (Discourse as a full-featured Rails app; a trending list that includes Rails projects like OpenProject and Zammad; and Mastodon as a Rails-based project) that collectively reinforce the prevalence and scale of Rails applications in open source. While none of the excerpts mention Vue.js or a DevOps-style end-to-end platform, they collectively demonstrate real-world Rails projects at scale, which is relevant to evaluating idiomatic Rails patterns, monolithic versus modular design choices, and the kinds of codebases a developer might study to inform portfolio-building and learning goals.",

            "\n\nThis repo implements 2 different approaches of Multitenancy. * Schema per tenant\n* Database per tenant [check it out](https://github.com/carloselpapa10/multitenancy/tree/feature/database-per-tenant)\n* Schema per tenant using mqtt requests (kafka broker) [check it out](https://github.com/carloselpapa10/multitenancy/tree/feature/schema-per-tenant-with-kafka)\n\n> Note: Master and develop branchs contain Schema per tenant approach. Understanding the Request Flow\n------------------------------\n\nThe process to establish a multi-tenant communication usually consists of the following three steps:\n\n1. Accept the incoming connection, and authenticate the user if necessary. 2. Intercept the request and identify the tenant for which the user is issuing the request. 3. Establish a connection with the database or schema of the tenant. Tenant identification is performed against a default schema, which contains the user's information. A user can authenticate himself on an external service and then pass the tenant information using an HTTP header or a Mqtt header. Prerequisites\n-------------\n\n* Java 8 or greater\n* Apache Maven\n* Git\n* Docker\n\nHow to run it?\n--------------\n\nRun this Docker command to create a mysql database. ```\n$ docker run --name mysqldb -p 3309:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=rootpassword -d mysql:latest\n```\n\n### Schema per tenant approach\n\nInstall the maven application\n\n```\n$ mvn clean install -DskipTests\n```\n\nRun the application\n\n```\n$ mvn spring-boot:run\n```\n\n### Database per tenant approach\n\nCheck out the database per tenant branch\n\n```\n$  git checkout feature/database-per-tenant\n```\n\nInstall the maven application\n\n```\n$ mvn clean install -DskipTests\n```\n\nRun the application\n\n```\n$ mvn spring-boot:run\n```\n\nRegister each tenant manually in the public database. So, each row, each tenant\n\n```\nINSERT INTO public.DataSourceConfig VALUES (1, 'com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver', 'jdbc:mysql://localhost:3309/test1?ApplicationName=MultiTenant', 'test1', 'root', 'rootpassword', true);\nINSERT INTO public.DataSourceConfig VALUES (2, 'com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver', 'jdbc:mysql://localhost:3309/test2?ApplicationName=MultiTenant', 'test2', 'root', 'rootpassword', true);\n```\n\nStop the application (Ctrl + C) and start it again to apply the changes.",

Additionally, there is a stronger contextual support for the project-management domain itself: one excerpt notes that OpenProject is a leading open-source project management software, which matches the category of the application described in the field value. However, neither excerpt explicitly confirms an Angular frontend or the exact combination of Angular frontend with a Rails API backend for the same project. The first excerpt confirms Rails API compatibility in a Rails-based project, which is relevant to the backend portion of the field value, while the second excerpt reinforces the PM software context (project management domain) though it lacks details on the tech stack. Taken together, the most supportive connections are: (a) Rails API backend capability as evidenced by a Rails-based project with REST API, and (b) the identification of the software domain as project management software, which aligns with the field value's domain descriptor.

Additional excerpts describe Solidus as a flexible Rails-based e-commerce solution and highlight its extensibility and backend customization, which supports the notion of configurability and adaptability across different business models. Other entries note that Spree and Solidus are traditional Rails e-commerce solutions, which helps establish the landscape of Rails-based marketplaces and their capacity to handle various requirements (e.g., multi-store, multi-vendor, localization, and currency). Finally, schema references and OpenFoodNetwork mentions provide concrete Rails ecosystem context (for example, references to Rails-based tables and backend schemas), further supporting the overall claim that Rails-based e-commerce platforms exist and can be extended.

Additional excerpts discuss other major Rails apps (such as Spree and Discourse), which provides contextual support that Rails ecosystem contains large, active OSS projects; this reinforces the plausibility that a project like GitLab operates at scale within the Rails landscape. However, none of the excerpts explicitly describe GitLab's architecture, scalability metrics, deployment strategies, or enterprise-grade CI/CD capabilities, so the evidence stops short of proving enterprise-scale deployment or millions-of-users support.

Closely related is the description of the starter as a template for building a SaaS application, which implies it provides the core SaaS features you would expect in a production-ready starting point (such as user authentication, dashboards, and subscription/payment flow). The presence of authentication with a mechanism suitable for a multi-user app, a dashboard with CRUD capabilities, and Stripe integration further reinforces the notion that the starter includes the essential, production-facing components that teams rely on when building and deploying real applications. Additional context about broader features (e.g., marketing landing page) helps establish that the starter covers typical SaaS surface areas, supporting its overall suitability as a modern starting point.

This aligns with the field's assertion of three core services each having its own database (MongoDB) and the architectural complexity typical of a microservice setup. It also shows a concrete, end-to-end configuration that mirrors the three-service/multi-database pattern the field describes. The next set of excerpts explicitly references microservice patterns in Spring Boot ecosystems, including use of a gateway pattern (Zuul) and a service discovery mechanism (Eureka). This corroborates the field's enumeration of the architectural components—classic Spring Cloud patterns commonly associated with a three-service/multi-database layout in older but instructional contexts. The presence of these components in multiple excerpts strengthens the mapping to the field's described architectural stack (Eureka, Zuul, Hystrix) and reinforces the \"classic\" flavor of the architecture. A further excerpt highlights PiggyMetrics-style microservice architecture built with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud, which reinforces the same pattern of distributed services and containerized deployment, again matching the field's focus on idiomatic Spring Cloud practice in a multi-service setup. Additional excerpts mention microservices patterns and patterns like API gateways, service discovery, and distributed tracing in related projects, which further contextualize the classic ecosystem around Spring Cloud microservices patterns. Finally, there is an excerpt describing FTGO as having a microservice architecture, which supports the broader idea of distributed service composition, albeit without the MongoDB detail; it still strengthens the pattern context for \"microservice architecture with multiple services.\" Taken together, the strongest, most targeted evidence is the docker-compose excerpt showing MongoDB per service and a multi-service layout, followed by explicit mentions of Zuul, Eureka, and related Spring Cloud microservice patterns in other excerpts. The field's explicit notes about obsolescence of older Spring Boot versions and learning value also align with excerpts that discuss older Spring Cloud patterns and classic architectures, though those mentions are more contextual rather than as explicit architectural blueprints. Overall, the evidence coherently supports the claimed architecture pattern and its educational value, with MongoDB per service and a three-service/multi-database flavor being the most solid anchor.",

This demonstrates substantial breadth and practical applicability across core Spring ecosystem concepts, which supports high growth potential from a practitioner's perspective, even if not officially branded. The presence of up-to-date references (e.g., Spring Boot 3 updates), and comprehensive tooling coverage (gateway, discovery, tracing, configuration, API docs) signals strong adaptability and depth, which are components of growth potential. The lack of explicit official endorsement weakens the claim of \"official, well-documented\" provenance, which prevents full alignment with the stated value.

      "reasoning": "The most directly supportive content shows a docker-compose-like layout where several services are backed by separate MongoDB databases (auth-mongodb, account-mongodb, statistics-mongodb, notification-mongodb, etc.). This directly aligns with the stated design of three core services each with its own database. Additional supporting content demonstrates the Spring Cloud patterning around service discovery and API gateway usage, including references to Eureka for discovery, Zuul as a gateway (and its variants), and Hystrix for circuit breaking. Collectively, these excerpts corroborate the idea of a classic microservice layout built with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud components, including an architectural pattern where each service owns its data store and communicate through standard Spring Cloud mechanisms. One excerpt explicitly notes a microservice architecture pattern using Spring Boot and Spring Cloud, reinforcing the overall framework indended, while another emphasizes the combination of Eureka, Zuul, and OpenFeign in a Spring Cloud context, which strengthens the evidence for gateway and discovery components in such architectures. The aggregation suggests a multi-service Spring Cloud setup with per-service databases as described, even if the exact phrasing of three core services with MongoDB is not verbatim in every reference. The reasoning thus rests on concrete indicators of per-service databases and established Spring Cloud patterns that underpin the described architecture.",
