  "input": "Wholesome Meet-Cute Stories Database Prompt\nResearch Briefing & Objective:\n\nYou are a Digital Story Scout and Content Curator for a media brand focused on positive and uplifting human interest stories. Your mission is to build a comprehensive database of authentic, wholesome \"meet-cute\" stories sourced from various corners of the internet. This database will be the primary source for creating viral social media content, articles, and newsletter features.\n\nPhase 1: Search & Selection Criteria\n\nYour goal is to find genuine, user-submitted anecdotes that describe the initial meeting of two people in a charming, quirky, or serendipitous way.\n\nSource Platforms: Your primary search areas should be Reddit (e.g., r/AskReddit threads about relationships, r/MadeMeSmile, r/howyoumet), long-form Twitter threads, Tumblr text posts, and personal blog comment sections.\n\nWholesome & Authentic: The story must be positive, heartwarming, and feel like a genuine personal experience. Exclude any stories that involve manipulation, significant negativity, or unhealthy dynamics.\n\nMeet-Cute Definition: The narrative must focus on the very beginning of the connection—the first interaction.\n\nPhase 2: Dataset Compilation & Final Deliverable\n\nThe final output must be a comprehensive table in CSV format, with each row representing a single, unique meet-cute story. Aim for an extensive collection of at least 1,000 unique meet-cute stories.\n\nThe table must have the following exact headers:\n\nStory_URL (A direct link to the original comment or post)\n\nStory_Text (The full, verbatim text of the anecdote)\n\nStory_Summary\n\nSource_Platform\n\nMeeting_Context\n\nKey_Wholesome_Element\n\nRelationship_Outcome\n\nConstraint Checklist:\nStory_Text: You must capture the full, verbatim text of the story in this column. This is the core content.\n\nStory_Summary: Provide a concise, one-sentence summary of the meet-cute (e.g., \"Two people met at a dog park when their identical-looking dogs got mixed up.\").\n\nMeeting_Context: Classify the setting or situation of the meeting. Use standardized tags like: Everyday Location (e.g., coffee shop, grocery store), Travel, Online (e.g., game, forum), Work/School, Shared Hobby.\n\nKey_Wholesome_Element: Identify the specific detail that makes the story charming (e.g., \"Humorous Misunderstanding,\" \"Shared Obscure Interest,\" \"Unexpected Act of Kindness,\" \"Serendipitous Coincidence\").\n\nRelationship_Outcome: If the story mentions what happened next, briefly note it (e.g., \"Got married,\" \"Became best friends,\" \"Dated for 5 years,\" \"Outcome not mentioned\").",

For instance, excerpts that invite or recount meet-cute stories from readers (such as frames where someone shares exactly how they met their partner in a real-world scenario) provide direct evidence of a meet-cute, which aligns with the target field collecting real-world initiation events. Specifically: - A post that asks people to share their meet-cute stories demonstrates the ongoing collection and type of content that constitutes meet-cute narratives. The included example describes meeting a partner at a World of Warcraft clan meeting followed by a cafe chat and a long-term relationship, which is a concrete meet-cute narrative. - Entries that recount a couple meeting due to serendipitous circumstances on a flight, or via a classroom encounter, or via a bar acknowledgment, illustrate classic meet-cute motifs (serendipity, humor, intentional setup by others, etc.). - Compilations and discussions explicitly titled around the concept of meet-cute (e.g., \"The Art Of The Meet Cute\") provide additional, thematically aligned content and can be mapped to the narrative pattern the field is designed to capture. - Other items that recount a specific couple's first interaction (e.g., being seated next to someone on a flight and deciding to travel together, or a person meeting through a friend at a party) map directly to the field's value by describing the initial encounter that starts a relationship. The excerpts chosen as highly relevant thus directly support the field's intended data: first contact moments that spark a relationship, often in charming or serendipitous ways. The subsequent excerpts, while still about meet-cute themes, serve to contextualize or broaden the corpus (e.g., compilations, discussions, or broader overviews), and are listed after the most direct narratives. This ordering ensures the most precise alignment with the field value while preserving a broader contextual set for completeness.",

Additional excerpts discussing the concept of what a meet-cute is (defining it as a moment of awkwardness or a quick introduction between two characters) provide contextual support for the essence of the field value, even if they describe the concept rather than a specific instance. Collectively, these excerpts map onto themes of initial interaction, charm, and serendipity that the field value embodies, with the strongest direct support coming from narratives that describe the very first meeting in a tangible, social setting, followed by other examples that illustrate similar first-contact scenarios.",

      "reasoning": "The most relevant information points to meet-cute scenarios that occur in social or bar-like settings and involve an engaging first interaction between two people. For instance, one excerpt describes going to a bar, meeting a group of friends, and noticing a charming stranger, which aligns with a bar-meet-cute context and the theme of a memorable first encounter. Another excerpt recounts meeting a future spouse during college while working on a shared project, illustrating a vivid first-meeting scenario in an experiential setting. These examples connect to the idea of a serendipitous first interaction in a social venue and the potential positive outcome that follows, which is the core of the finegrained field value. Other excerpts provide broader definitions of what a meet-cute is or discuss general lists of ideas, which are relevant to context but do not directly support the specific bar-meet-cute and long-term relationship outcome described in the field value. Therefore, the most supportive excerpts explicitly depict initial meet-cute interactions in social environments, while less direct excerpts offer contextual understanding of the concept without confirming the exact scenario or outcome. The direct alignment to a bar or social setting with a notable first encounter and a positive future outcome is what elevates relevance for the target field value.",

An additional excerpt notes meeting a partner through an activity at work, highlighting an early interaction that grew into a relationship, closely mirroring the initial meet-cute concept in a shared context like classes or work. A third excerpt references a bar meeting that led to a relationship, which, while not an academic setting, still demonstrates the core mechanism of a charming first encounter leading to dating, thus contributing to the broader understanding of meet-cute narratives. Other excerpts discuss the general definition of a meet-cute or long-standing relationships formed in school, which provide contextual support for the concept but do not directly illustrate the same initial interaction dynamics as the target story. Collectively, these excerpts support the idea that an initial, serendipitous or prompted interaction within an educational or work setting can spark a lasting relationship, which is consistent with the fine-grained field value describing a professor-influenced, first-meeting scenario and subsequent dating.",

Another excerpt notes meeting a partner in youth, later marrying, or dating after a notable first interaction, reinforcing the central motif of a memorable first connection that blossoms over time. A third excerpt mentions meeting one's spouse in a college setting during a shared activity, again emphasizing the initial encounter as a pivotal moment. Other excerpts discuss general definitions or discussions of meet-cute concepts, which provide context but are less directly tied to a specific initial interaction or outcome.

Directly relevant content includes: a line indicating a personal meet-cute where someone met their partner while serving a group at work, which demonstrates the core notion of a first meeting leading to romance; another excerpt notes meeting a spouse in college during a production, illustrating a first-interaction meet-cute; a general excerpt discussing what a meet-cute is and how it functions in storytelling, which provides a framework for identifying the defining elements of a meet-cute rather than the specific Tumblr instance. Additional excerpts describe other personal meet-cute anecdotes (bar encounter, long-term dating timelines, etc.), which reinforce the broader concept of the initial connection being heartwarming and pivotal, even if they do not match the Tumblr-online illustration commission scenario exactly. Taken together, these excerpts support the existence and structure of \"meet-cute\" narratives but offer limited direct evidence for the precise Tumblr-based, online, illustration-commission meet-cute described in the field value.

Excerpts that describe a meet-cute arising in an online or shared-interest context are therefore the most relevant: one excerpt mentions meeting someone in a bar but highlights a subsequent connection via a shared interest, which illustrates how a shared interest can seed a meet-cute. Other excerpts discuss college settings or workplace scenarios that center on a first interaction but do not specifically involve online platforms or shared obscure interests; these provide contextual support for the concept of a meet-cute but are less directly aligned with the online/shared-interest mechanism. Additional excerpts define what a meet-cute is or offer generic lists of meet-cute ideas, which help validate the taxonomy (Online, Shared Hobby, Humorous/Serendipitous elements) but do not directly support the exact online+shared-interest narrative. Taken together, the strongest alignment is with online/shared-interest mechanisms and the general concept of a meet-cute, while explicit evidence for the exact tweet-based instance (Twitter/X) or the specific Wes Johnson overlap is not present in the provided excerpts.",

Another highly relevant excerpt describes meeting a future spouse during a college project, which also captures the essence of a first engagement that leads to a lasting relationship.

Excerpt describing a meeting at work fits this context, providing direct support for the Work/School setting aspect. Excerpts that describe meeting in college also align with an educational context, reinforcing that school-related meet-cutes are common themes. Other excerpts describe meet-cute moments in social or online settings (bar encounters, online platforms), which are less aligned with the provided field value's context but still illustrate the broad concept of a first encounter. While none of the excerpts reproduce the exact story (the chemistry teacher seating arrangement and the specific marriage outcome), the closest matches are those that explicitly situate the meet-cute within a school or work environment, thereby supporting the contextual relevance of the field value and helping validate that such a narrative type exists within the dataset. Therefore, the most relevant excerpts are those that depict initial meetings in work or school contexts, followed by those that portray college or broad meet-cute scenarios, with bar/online contexts considered less relevant for this specific field value.",

This aligns with the field value's emphasis on a meeting occurring in a professional or demanding context and leading to a lasting relationship. The next-most relevant excerpts describe similar beginnings in education or collaborative environments (college play, wardrobe/acting collaboration), which still fit the general \"meet at a beginning of a connection\" theme and hint at long-term relationships. Other excerpts reference meet-cute concepts or list ideas without tying to a specific, high-stakes connection or long-term outcome; these provide contextual support for the concept of a meet-cute but do not directly echo the precise high-stakes work context and marriage outcome in the field value. Specifically, quotes indicating \"met my partner while at work\" or \"met in college while collaborating on a project\" are most aligned, while general discussions of meet-cute ideas or threads about relationships are less targeted. Based on these alignments, the excerpts are ordered from closest to farthest in supporting the field value, with the strongest support coming from the work-context anecdote and follow-ons from similar environments, and progressively weaker support from broader or unrelated meet-cute discussions.",

For example, a story where someone is struck by another person's charm during a first interaction at work or in college highlights the meet-cute moment that starts a relationship, which is central to the field value.\n- Other excerpts also describe initial meet-cute moments in everyday locations or social settings (such as meeting someone in college during a shared activity or encountering a group of friends at a bar), which demonstrates the core concept of a first meeting that evolves into a relationship. These support the interpretation of a meet-cute as an initial serendipitous moment rather than later-stage developments.\n- Some excerpts discuss broader definitions or frameworks of what a meet-cute is, which helps contextualize why the initial meeting is the focal point of such stories, aligning with the field value's emphasis on the very beginning of the connection.\n- None of the excerpts provide the exact unwitting mother-in-law setup or drive-in date outcome described in the field value; however, the ones that emphasize the initial encounter and the charm of the first interaction are the most relevant as they ground the concept of a meet-cute that begins a positive relationship. Other excerpts mentioning later outcomes or general discussions of meet-cutes contribute background but do not directly corroborate the specific details of the field value.",

The strongest match recounts meeting in a bar where the narrator ran into a group of friends and encountered someone charming, which aligns with a spontaneous, serendipitous scenario. Other excerpts describe meetings that occur during a structured activity (working at a job, in college during a play, or initial social engagement in a more deliberate setting), which are less indicative of serendipitous coincidence as the core cause of the meeting. Therefore, the most relevant content directly supports the notion of an accidental, chance-driven first interaction, while the remaining excerpts contribute to a broader collection of meet-cute narratives but do not as strongly establish serendipity as the central mechanism of the initial meeting.",

Among the excerpts, the strongest alignment is found in a bar-based encounter where the narrator meets someone new in that same environment, which provides a realistic and vivid example of a first interaction in a social venue. Next, other excerpts depict initial encounters in varied contexts (e.g., meeting a partner in college while working on a play, or meeting someone while serving a group at work). These illustrate the core concept of a meet-cute—the first interaction leading to connection—but they do not replicate the exact bar-side, sleeping-on-the-shoulder trigger described in the target value. Several excerpts discuss the general idea and definition of a meet-cute, or provide broader lists of scenarios, which offer contextual support for understanding the phenomenon but do not directly illustrate the precise event in the field value. Taken together, the most relevant content centers on bar encounters and first-interaction dynamics, with decreasing relevance as the excerpts shift to different settings or to meta-discussion about meet-cute concepts.",

The idea of meeting a future husband in college directly corroborates the intended field value that the meet-cute implied they became a couple. - The second strongest support comes from a narrative where a person meets their partner and references a long-term relationship, indicating that the meet-cute progressed to a lasting connection. - An earlier-life account describing meeting a future husband and becoming close friends over time also supports the idea of eventual togetherness, though it requires a bit more inference about the final outcome. - An excerpt asking about meeting the love of their life is relevant insofar as it indicates a romantic connection formed, which aligns with the implication of the field value, but it does not state a concrete outcome. Overall, the most relevant parts explicitly state or strongly imply that the meet-cute led to a relationship, with some excerpts requiring inference for the final outcome.",

Among the excerpts, the one closest to this outcome states that the person met their husband, implying a trajectory toward marriage, which aligns with the general theme of a significant relationship milestone though it does not explicitly mention engagement or children. Other excerpts describe initial meet-cutes or relationships without mentioning any engagement or family planning details, so they are less relevant to the specified field value. There is no explicit mention of engagement or having a child in any excerpt, so the field value cannot be fully supported by the provided text; the strongest link is the implicit implication of marriage in the excerpt about meeting a future spouse, but it remains indirect and incomplete for the exact field value requested.",

      "reasoning": "The fine-grained field value describes a deliberate first-step encounter initiated within a graduate-level class, a highly specific classroom meeting. The most relevant excerpts are those that depict meeting a future partner in an academic or college context, which show the general pattern of a first encounter within an organized setting like a school or college. For example, an excerpt describing meeting a partner in college during a shared activity (such as a play) demonstrates the core element of meeting in an educational environment and initiating contact at the outset of a relationship. Another excerpt mentions meeting a spouse in college as well, reinforcing the relevance of the college context to initial contact scenarios. Excerpts that describe meet-cute occurrences in non-academic contexts (e.g., work, bars, online forums) either describe different settings or less direct initiation of contact, and thus are less supportive of the specific classroom-based scenario. The collectible gist across the more relevant excerpts is that the initial meeting happens in a structured setting related to school or college and involves an upfront moment of recognizing or initiating interest, which aligns with the concept of a deliberate first interaction in an educational context. Overall, the strongest support comes from passages that anchor the meet-cute in college or school-related settings, while other excerpts provide contextual or peripheral evidence about meet-cute dynamics without proving the exact classroom-initiated contact described in the field value.",

Excerpts that mention Reddit threads or posts about meet-cute stories provide the strongest, most direct relevance to this field value, since they establish the content domain and platform for the target URL. Directly, one excerpt describes a request for meet-cute stories on Reddit, another notes meeting a partner during college on Reddit, and others discuss meet-cutes in Reddit communities or Romance/relationship threads. These excerpts collectively corroborate that the target value belongs to Reddit-based meet-cute narratives and help anchor the expected structure (Story_URL pointing to a Reddit post about a meet-cute) in the broader context of similar posts. Excerpts that mention other platforms (e.g., a general article on meet-cutes or non-Reddit sources) are still somewhat relevant as context but are less directly tied to the specific URL path and platform in question. Therefore, the most relevant content centers on Reddit discussions about meet-cute stories, followed by related Reddit discussions about meet-cutes, and finally non-Reddit sources that discuss the concept more generally.",

Specifically, text that describes meeting a partner during an ongoing interaction (such as being served in a setting, or meeting in college while working on a play) demonstrates the core concept of a first, serendipitous encounter that kicks off a relationship. Descriptions that explicitly address what a meet-cute is (e.g., a playful or awkward first interaction) help validate the context for the field value, even though they do not reproduce the exact narrative. Less directly supportive are items that discuss general ideas about meet-cute concepts or provide lists/summaries of potential meet-cute moments, which offer contextual background but do not demonstrate a narrative instance. The remaining items include broader discussions about meet-cute definitions or collections of ideas that are not tied to a concrete story text, and thus provide only peripheral relevance. Given that none of the excerpts provides the exact described storyline, the substantive support comes from excerpts that showcase concrete meet-cute anecdotes or definitions, which frame the type of content the field value represents.",

Another excerpt asks about others meeting a future spouse, which indicates the outcome category but without a direct confirmation of marriage. The remaining excerpts describe the initial meeting or define the concept of a meet-cute, which are relevant to the context but do not directly support the specific outcome of marriage. Specifically, a line about meeting a husband in college ties the meet-cute directly to a long-term partnership, while the reference to dating a future spouse demonstrates the potential outcome without confirming marriage. The bar encounter excerpt narrates the initial meeting but does not indicate any subsequent long-term outcome, so its support for the exact field value is weaker but still contextually relevant. The definition-focused excerpts provide context for what a meet-cute is but do not address outcomes at all.",

The first excerpt directly recounts a first-meeting moment at work where one person is struck by the other's charm, which is closest to the concept of a serendipitous first interaction, though it does not mention a humorous misunderstanding. The next few excerpts describe other early meet-cute moments (e.g., meeting in college while working on a play, meeting someone in a bar) and general explanations of what a meet-cute is, which are relevant for understanding the broader pattern of initial encounters but do not confirm the humorous misunderstanding motif. Additional excerpts discuss meeting scenarios and categorization of meet-cute content, which helps contextualize what makes a meet-cute, but again do not provide evidence that the humorous misunderstanding element occurred in those stories. Overall, there is no explicit confirmation of the target fine-grained value in the provided excerpts; they mainly offer context about meet-cute events rather than the specific humorous misunderstanding detail.

Following that, excerpts describing meeting a partner at college or starting a relationship that progresses toward long-term commitment are relevant as partial support, even if they do not state the exact duration. Other excerpts discuss the concept of meet-cutes in general or describe dating trajectories without committing to a marriage outcome, which are less directly supportive of the specific field value.

Excerpts that define what a meet-cute is or discuss ideas about meet-cutes in media provide contextual boundaries for the concept but do not directly substantiate the specific classroom scenario described in the target value.

This aligns with the idea of finding a connection in an unexpected, potentially high-stress moment that arises serendipitously during a demanding activity. The excerpt directly ties the initial interaction to a charming, interpersonal moment within a practical, pressured context (serving a group at work), illustrating the core of a meet-cute that emerges in a stressful or unexpected environment. Other excerpts discuss meet-cutes in more routine or non-stressful contexts (college, bar, online forums, childhood friends, or generic definitions) and do not clearly demonstrate a high-stress or unexpected environmental factor driving the connection.

For example, a snippet mentions meeting a partner while serving a group at work in a Reddit thread, another discusses meeting a spouse in college via a theater project in a Reddit thread, and another depicts meeting a future partner after encountering a group of friends in a Reddit context. These directly support the notion that meet-cute stories can originate from Reddit communities and follow a first-meeting narrative. Additional excerpts discuss the definition and framing of meet-cutes within Reddit- or romance-related spaces, which provide supportive context for how such URLs and stories are typically structured. Finally, some excerpts reference broader lists or ideas about meet-cute moments that are not Reddit-specific but still pertain to the general concept and would be useful for data curation and framing in the absence of the exact URL.",

Excerpt describing a first-day meeting during a college project suggests the two characters feel a strong initial draw from their very first interaction, aligning with the idea of an instant connection. Excerpt noting that someone was struck by how charming the other person was also supports rapid attraction at first sight, which is consistent with an instant, meaningful connection. Excerpts that explain the concept of meet-cute generally emphasize the initial interaction and immediate dynamics between people, providing contextual support for the broader notion of an instant, wholesome connection even if they do not explicitly label it as such. Taken together, these excerpts most strongly support the concept of an immediate, deep connection at first meeting, with varying degrees of directness in describing the instant impact.",

      "reasoning": "The most relevant excerpt describes a meeting that happened during a college production, where two people were involved in different roles (acting and wardrobe) and thus situates the meet-cute within a Work/School context. This directly supports categorizing the meeting context as a structured tag like Work/School rather than a generic or online event. Another excerpt notes meeting while one was serving a group at work, which is a clear Work context as well, reinforcing the idea that the initial interaction occurred in a real-world, organized setting rather than online or purely casual environments. The remaining excerpts discuss the concept of a meet-cute and general definitions rather than a specific setting, which makes them less directly supportive of a concrete Meeting_Context label but still relevant for understanding the nature of meet-cute storytelling. Collectively, these excerpts anchor the context to in-person, real-world settings (e.g., college/work) rather than online or travel scenarios, aligning with the expected taxonomy for Meeting_Context, though they do not explicitly use the exact label 'Event'.",

These passages directly establish the platform as Reddit, which exactly matches the field value being verified.
