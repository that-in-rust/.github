  "input": "Act as a market expansion strategist for a global technology firm. Your goal is to identify well-funded, high-growth private companies that have already established or are likely to establish a presence in India.\n\nYour task is to compile a structured dataset of global, privately-held companies that meet the following core criteria:\n1.  Total funding raised is greater than $10 million USD.\n2.  The company has completed at least a Series A funding round.\n\nThe final output must be a comprehensive table in CSV format with the following headers:\n1.  CompanyName\n2.  HQ_Country\n3.  Industry_Sector\n4.  TotalFunding_USD\n5.  LastFundingType\n6.  LastFundingDate\n7.  KeyInvestors\n8.  EstimatedEmployeeCount\n9.  IndiaPresenceAndAddress\n10. WebsiteAddress\n11. CareersPageURL\n\n### Constraint Checklist:\n- **India Presence**: This is the primary research goal. For the 'IndiaPresenceAndAddress' column, investigate the company's official website (e.g., contact pages, location lists). If a registered office or a Global Capability Center (GCC) in India is confirmed, format the entry as 'Yes - [Full Address of primary India office]'. If no presence is found after checking the website, enter 'No'.\n- **Funding & Investor Data**: Source this information from public announcements, company press releases, or reputable tech/financial news outlets.\n- **Data Timeliness**: Prioritize companies that have received a funding round within the last 36 months to ensure the list is current and relevant.\n- **Company Type**: Strictly exclude publicly-listed companies. The focus is entirely on private, venture-backed entities.\n- **Employee Count**: The 'EstimatedEmployeeCount' should be the latest available estimate, often sourced from the company's official LinkedIn page or website.",

    "executive_summary": "For a market expansion strategist, the Indian market presents a significant and growing opportunity, particularly as a hub for Global Capability Centers (GCCs) and core engineering talent. Our research has identified a robust pipeline of well-funded, private technology companies that have already established a significant footprint in India or are actively expanding.\n\n**Companies with Confirmed, Substantial India Presence:**\nA premier group of companies has established formal, physical offices and are aggressively scaling their Indian operations. These represent the most mature opportunities:\n*   **Rippling:** A standout example with its largest office outside the US located in Bengaluru. The company is doubling its Indian workforce from 1,000 to 2,000, backed by a recent $450M Series G round. Its presence is solidified with a new 100,000 sq ft office.\n*   **Databricks:** Operates multiple offices in Bengaluru and Mumbai. With a recent term sheet for a Series K round valuing it over $100B, its investment in India is substantial.\n*   **GCC Leaders:** Several firms have recently launched or expanded their GCCs, signaling a long-term strategic commitment. This includes **Arctic Wolf** (new GCC in Bengaluru, hiring 150+), **NAVEX** (permanent GCC in Bangalore with ~100 experts), **Rapid7** (new GCC in Pune), **Moveworks** (Bengaluru office as its second HQ), **Reveleer** (GCC in OMR, India), and **Exostar India** (new larger office in Bangalore).\n*   **Established Players:** **Stripe** and **Netskope** also maintain confirmed offices in Bengaluru, leveraging the city's tech ecosystem.\n\n**Companies with Strong Operational Presence & Imminent Expansion:**\nThis group leverages India for core functions, often with a remote-first or hybrid model, indicating deep integration of Indian talent:\n*   **Keychain:** A US-based CPG startup whose core engineering and product development is centered in Gurugram. It plans to double its India-based engineering team from 35 to 70.\n*   **Coralogix:** An Israeli observability firm investing $100M in India over five years to expand its engineering base in Gurugram and hire in Bengaluru and Mumbai. India is its second-largest market.\n*   **Sardine.ai:** A fraud and compliance platform that, while remote-first, actively hires for technical roles in India, listing specific salary ranges in INR for positions in Mumbai and other remote locations.\n*   **Aspire, Sprinto, and Eudia:** These companies are all actively hiring for key roles (Engineering, Sales, Strategy) in Indian tech hubs like Bengaluru and Gurugram, with Eudia confirming an \"India Site Lead\" to oversee its local team.\n\n**Companies with No or Low India Expansion Signals:**\nSeveral companies were investigated and found to have a primary focus on North American or other markets, with no current plans for India expansion. These include **Pogo (joinpogo.com)**, which explicitly limits its service to the US; **Anterior**, focused on the US healthcare system; **Govly**, targeting US public sector procurement; and specialized firms like **X-Bow Systems** (defense), **NewLimit** (biotech), and **Chestnut Carbon** (US-based carbon removal).\n\n**Strategic Conclusion:**\nThe trend is clear: global technology firms are not just outsourcing to India but are establishing core R&D, engineering, and operational hubs there. Bengaluru, Gurugram, Pune, and Hyderabad are the epicenters of this activity. The most promising companies for strategic engagement are those like Rippling, Databricks, Keychain, and Coralogix, which have demonstrated a deep, strategic commitment to integrating Indian talent and operations into their global growth plans.",

    "india_market_expansion_context": "The Indian market presents a compelling, albeit complex, opportunity for global technology firms, characterized by several key trends. A primary driver is the significant expansion of Global Capability Centers (GCCs), with over 250 new centers anticipated. This trend, exemplified by companies like Costco, ZS, and Rapid7 opening or expanding GCCs in hubs like Hyderabad, Pune, and Bengaluru, underscores India's strategic importance as a global talent and innovation hub. This is further evidenced by the operational strategies of companies like Keychain, which centers its core engineering and product development in Gurugram, following a 'build in India, grow in the U.S.' model. The venture capital landscape in India is also showing signs of recovery, with funding in H1 2025 reaching $4.9 billion, a 9% year-over-year increase, and over 20 startups preparing for IPOs. The strategic partnership between the U.S. and India, particularly through the U.S.–India Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET), is designed to deepen technological cooperation and encourage cross-border investment. However, expansion requires navigating specific regulatory landscapes. In the defense sector, while India's MTCR membership and STA-1 status facilitate technology transfer, the 'Make in India' policy and Defence Acquisition Procedure (DAP) strongly prioritize indigenous manufacturing, making joint ventures and local production essential for market entry. Similarly, the fintech sector is governed by the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) strict framework, which includes data localization mandates requiring all payment data to be stored exclusively in India, and tight controls over card issuance and B2B payments, making partnerships with licensed Indian banks a prerequisite for foreign firms."

The strongest support comes from excerpts that explicitly label Instantly as unfunded or state there is no funding information available, which directly substantiates the ineligibility claim. A passage stating that Instantly is unfunded clearly indicates no Series A or later round occurred, satisfying the criterion for ineligibility. Additional excerpts noting the absence of funding information corroborate the core conclusion, even if they do not proclaim it as definitively unfunded. Other excerpts discuss Instantly.ai in the context of ARR figures or general company details, which are informative but do not directly confirm the funding status and thus are weaker for asserting ineligibility. Taken together, the strongest support is the explicit unfunded designation, with subsequent no-funding-information notes reinforcing the conclusion. Overall, the evidence from these excerpts supports classifying Instantly.ai as ineligible due to bootstrapped status and lack of external funding within the reported timeframe, which is the central claim of the field value.",

Costco's plan to launch a Global Capability Centre in Hyderabad demonstrates a formal GCC expansion in India, directly supporting the notion that GCCs are expanding across Indian tech hubs. Arctic Wolf's opening of its first India office in Bengaluru likewise signals a strategic push to establish in-country engineering and security capabilities. Arctic Wolf's Bengaluru location, plus the described hiring plans, underscores India as a core growth and innovation hub. Additional mentions of Bengaluru and other Indian campuses in subsequent excerpts reinforce the GCC/India presence narrative. Keychain's Gurugram-based core engineering and product development illustrates a build-in-India, grow-elsewhere model, highlighting a private/private-backed company leveraging India as a development nexus. Moveworks' first office in India (Bengaluru) further confirms multinational tech footprint expansion into India. Databricks' India offices (Bengaluru and Mumbai) provide concrete evidence of established large tech groups operating locally, consistent with GCC-like or regional hub activity. Rippling's expansion in India, including a Bengaluru site and a strategy to grow its India presence, aligns with the broader pattern of U.S.-based tech firms expanding their engineering and product capabilities in India. Collectively, these excerpts illustrate a multi-faceted Indian market expansion context: GCC launches, regional engineering hubs, and a growing ecosystem of India-backed and India-based operations, all consistent with the described strategic opportunities and regulatory backdrop (GCCs, local presence, and cross-border collaboration). The combination of explicit GCC announcements, explicit India office openings, and explicit India-based engineering centers provides coherent, converging evidence for the stated field value.",

Additional entries show established engineering footprints and offices in India for Rippling (India as a major offshore center with a large Bengaluru footprint and a 100k sq ft office) and for Databricks (offices in Bengaluru and Mumbai with ongoing substantial India engagement). Moveworks is shown as having its first India office in Bengaluru (second HQ, signaling a strong India foothold). We also have evidence of Stripe and Netskope maintaining Bengaluru presence. There are further entries describing a broad set of Indian GCC activity and other multi-location office expansions (Weaver, NAVEX, Rapid7, Reveleer, etc.). These sources collectively corroborate the claim that India is a core, growing base for private tech firms, with well-funded companies establishing physical GCCs or large-scale engineering footprints, aligning with the summary's emphasis on India as a strategic growth engine and GCC hub. The strongest support comes from explicit mentions of GCCs and first/major offices in Bengaluru or Hyderabad, followed by corroborating notes about additional Indian offices and broad GCC activity. Overall, the evidence supports the executive_summary's assertion of substantial and growing India presence among well-funded private technology firms, including specific named companies and cities.",

For Keychain, excerpts describe a $30M Series B funding round in August 2025 and explicitly note India-centric engineering and product development in Gurugram, which satisfies the field value's requirements for high funding, private status, and India presence. For Sardine, excerpts confirm a Series C funding in February 2025 with a total funding around $145.6M and list active India hiring with Mumbai/India-Remote locations, which aligns with the field value's emphasis on substantial private funding and a defined India footprint. For Crux Informatics, excerpts show a Series B fundraising in May 2024 and indicate an India-based partner/hiring activity, supporting both funding and India presence assertions. The supporting excerpts for Coralogix and others provide context about India-focused expansion plans or private funding, but lack the precise combination of large private funding rounds plus explicit, addressable India presence within the 36-month window, so they are ranked after the strongest three. In short, entries that connect a high private funding milestone with a concrete India presence and/or address are given the highest relevance, while those that only partially confirm these elements are ranked lower but still contribute corroborating context.",

This set of details directly satisfies the core data points in the fine-grained field for Rippling. Additional excerpts corroborate Rippling's India footprint through office expansion and ongoing hiring/membership signals within India, reinforcing the presence claim beyond the fundraising data. For Databricks, the most relevant excerpts identify an India office location in Bengaluru with a concrete address, which confirms India presence and enables alignment with the field's India_presence_and_address entry, while other excerpts describe Databricks' broader funding trajectory in parallel sources. For Stripe, an India address is present in the excerpts, confirming India presence, though funding data in those excerpts is not explicit; the existence of an Indian office address is the key support for the India_presence_and_address portion. For Netskope, the excerpts similarly establish an India office location in Bengaluru, adding to the India presence evidence. Overall, the most valuable excerpts are those that directly state the India presence (office/address) and, where possible, tie in funding context to support the total_funding_usd and last_funding fields, with India office details anchoring the fine-grained field's India_presence_and_address value.",

Another excerpt describes the company as bootstrapped to a substantial ARR, which reinforces the bootstrapped status. Additional excerpts reiterate the bootstrap theme or describe growth without traditional funding, further supporting that the company operated without (or prior to) substantial external funding. A competing data point appears in an excerpt that references a Series D round, which would contradict the bootstrap narrative; this provides a potential nuance or exception and should be considered when assessing consistency of the bootstrap claim. Other excerpts provide contextual information about the company and its profile (growth outlook, general descriptions, and unrelated terms), which are less directly relevant to the bootstrap/ineligibility determination but still help triangulate the company's funding narrative. Taken together, the strongest support for the bootstrap/ineligibility rationale comes from statements of being unfunded and bootstrapped, with a caveat from funding round mentions that could introduce contradiction.",

The most directly relevant content is the explicit statement of being unfunded, followed by corroborating bootstrap-focused discussions, while funding-round mentions introduce conflict and reduce certainty. Consequently, the most relevant material is the bootstrap/unfunded descriptions, and the least relevant material is the funding-round references that could contradict the bootstrap claim.",

      "reasoning": "- Alaan: The excerpt explicitly notes a Series A funding round totalling $48M with Peak XV Partners as the lead investor (Peak XV is the rebranded form of Sequoia Capital India & SEA), which supports both the funding and the India-ties aspects. It also identifies the company's HQ as UAE-based, aligning with the field's HQ country. The excerpt stating Peak XV Partners (formerly Sequoia India & SEA) as lead investor directly links to Indian market ties and suggests strategic connections to India. The other Alaan excerpt confirms the Series A timing and the lead investor, reinforcing the funding facet of the field value and the India-ties through Peak XV.\n- Sardine: The excerpt detailing a Series C round totaling $145M with lead investor Activant Capital and participation from a16z, etc., directly supports the field's total funding and last funding type/date. Additional excerpts note India-related hiring activity (India - Remote, Mumbai roles) and explicit India presence in job postings, thus corroborating the field's India presence note. The combination of funding data and India-based hiring/remote roles provides strong evidence for the India ties described in the field value.\n- Crux Informatics: The Crux-related excerpts show a $50M Series B in 2024 (and related rounds) along with investor groups (Two Sigma, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Citi, etc.), supporting the funding portion of the field value. A Google Cloud Partner excerpt mentions India support, and other entries reference India-related activity or presence (crew locations, partnerships) indicating India ties even if not a formal India office. Taken together, these excerpts validate both the funding status and the India-connected aspects of Crux Informatics.\n- Keychain: The Keychain excerpts show a Series B around Aug 19, 2025 with $30M, and earlier Series B mentions (approx. $68M total) along with a Gurugram-based India hub/hiring footprint; these directly support the field's funding and explicit India presence. Several excerpts discuss India-based engineering teams and Gurugram expansion plans, which aligns well with the field value's India presence and address component. Additional entries show the company's ongoing expansion and Series B announcements, further supporting the field's data points.\n\nOverall confidence: high for Sardine, Crux Informatics, and Keychain given multiple direct data points (Series A/B/C rounds with dates and large investor rosters) plus explicit India presence or strong strategic India ties. For Alaan, confidence is medium to high for the funding and India-tie inference via Peak XV Partners, but the lack of a clearly stated India office in these excerpts makes the India presence signal slightly weaker than for the other three. The ordering prioritizes excerpts that most directly substantiate both funding details and India-related presence or ties.",

Excerpt describing the funding round clearly states the Series C and date (Feb 2025) and mentions lead investor Activant Capital, supporting the funding type and timing. Another excerpt corroborates the February 2025 timeframe and the existence of a Series C round. A third Sardine-focused excerpt also references the Series C context on Crunchbase and reinforces the association with Sardine.

Other excerpts that focus on funding rounds and investor names for different companies illustrate the funding context but do not provide India-specific corroboration for Eudia, making them less directly relevant. Overall, the connection is indirect: the excerpts best support the element of private funding activity with India presence, which aligns with the field value's India presence claim, but they do not verify Eudia's identity or funding specifics.",

The existence of an India address for the company contradicts or at least does not support the HQ country being USA & Ireland. Therefore, this excerpt is highly relevant to assessing the accuracy of the HQ country field but does not validate the provided value. It suggests that if the third company has an India-based office, the HQ country being USA & Ireland would be unlikely or require additional confirmation from the company's official HQ declarations.",

This directly contradicts the finegrained field value asserting that the last funding date was in 2023. Additionally, the excerpts reveal substantial operational activity tied to India, including an engineering and product team presence in Gurugram and an emphasis on building in India, which is relevant context for the broader field of 'significant operational presence' but does not corroborate a 2023 funding date. Specifically, the quotes show: (a) a funding announcement of $30 million in 2025, (b) the team expansion in Gurugram from a smaller headcount to a larger one, and (c) the India-based core engineering and product development being central to the company's growth plans. Taken together, these excerpts provide clear evidence that the last funding event occurred in 2025, not 2023, which undermines the specified field value and suggests a misalignment between the field value and the source material. The most directly relevant information to the field value is the explicit mention of a 2025 funding round, which invalidates the 2023 date asserted by the field value. The surrounding details about India presence reinforce the broader context of the company's operational footprint, but do not rectify the discrepancy in the funding date themselves.",

One excerpt states that the company's core engineering and product development are centered in India, which directly supports the notion of India-centric operations. Another excerpt specifically names Gurugram as the focal location for the India-based team and notes plans to grow the team there, which is the strongest corroboration. A third excerpt gives concrete numbers on increasing the Gurugram team size, reinforcing both presence and scale. Additional excerpts mention leveraging an India-based team to build and grow in India, which aligns with the presence narrative though with somewhat broader wording. A final excerpt references the overall funding context but does not add new information about the exact India location, and thus provides contextual support rather than direct confirming detail. Together, these excerpts collectively validate that the company has a Gurugram-centered India presence with expansion plans, matching the finegrained field value.",

X-Bow Systems is cited for its $105M Series B (May 12, 2025) and for its headquarters in the U.S. with no India presence noted. NewLimit's Series B of $130M (May 6, 2025) and investors are captured, with no India office indicated. Lithic's $60M Series C (July 28, 2021) and its investor list are included, with a note on India regulatory hurdles and no physical India presence. Rain's Series B of $75M (April 8, 2025) and the company's India absence are stated, along with its $191M total funding context. Chestnut Carbon's Series B of $160M (Feb 12, 2025) and its exclusive U.S. focus with no India presence are documented. Pogo's earlier Seed/Sec rounds totaling $14.8M (2022-07-26) are present with a note that service prohibits India-based users and India presence is not indicated. Each cited excerpt provides data points that map to the fields in the finegrained_field_value, including funding totals, last funding round/date, investors, HQ, and explicit India presence signals. Based on the density and directness of the mappings, the collection of excerpts collectively supports the stated field values for these companies, with the strongest single-excerpt support typically coming from funding dossiers and official press releases that list the exact round, date, and lead investors, complemented by explicit \"No India presence\" notes when provided. The nine companies are thus supported with corroborating funding and India-presence data across multiple excerpts, with India-presence consistently noted as absent where indicated, aligning with the field values that show 'No' or an explicit address-less absence for India in most cases. The overall confidence is mediated by occasional variation in whether India presence is explicitly stated in every source, but the funding data and explicit India absence/presence notes are consistently aligned with the field values across the provided excerpts.",

This aligns with the India presence aspect of the fine-grained field value, suggesting there is some level of corporate activity or collaboration in India. The excerpts discussing Crux's funding rounds demonstrate that the company has secured multiple funding events, including a Series B and publicly reported total funding figures from third-party aggregators. These pieces corroborate that Crux is a venture-backed private company with a notable capital-raising history, which is consistent with the notion of substantial total funding and a Series B round in the past. However, the exact total funding value in the field value (157 million) is not precisely echoed by these excerpts, which cite different totals from separate sources. Collectively, these excerpts support the existence of India-related activity and a venture-backed funding trajectory, while highlighting discrepancies in the precise cumulative funding amount reported across sources. The combination of an India-related partner/profile reference and funding round details supports the essence of the fine-grained field value, though with some variance in the exact total funding figure.",

This provides a concrete, near-term numeric anchor that directly touches on headcount in the relevant India operation. The statement that the India-based team is the core of engineering and product development reinforces that the India presence is central to operations, which corroborates why employee counts would be concentrated there. The note that the team helping scale internationally is entirely based in Gurugram further supports India-centric staffing, although it does not add a numeric figure.

The excerpt describing a February 2025 funding event (and identifying Activant Capital as lead investor) provides the strongest, most direct signal of a large-capital round, which is relevant to the target total funding value. Additional snippets referencing Sardine's funding activity (Series C and February 2025 timing) reinforce the interpretation of substantial investment activity without contradicting the target magnitude. Excerpts about Keychain note a $30 million round, which is clearly smaller than 105 million and thus less supportive of the specific value, but still relevant as context for the nature of recent private funding activity in the dataset. Excerpts describing India-related operational details for Keychain help contextualize India presence but do not directly affect the funding magnitude for the field value. Overall, the reasoning supports that a large funding event occurred for Sardine (likely around the 105M range) within the relevant window, but the exact dollar amount is not explicitly stated in the excerpts, introducing a degree of uncertainty about the precise figure.\n",

However, none of the excerpts provide the actual list of investors (Andreessen Horowitz, Insight Partners, Thrive Capital, WCM Investment Management). Because the exact investor names are not present in the excerpts, the evidence for the specific key_investors value is lacking. The remaining excerpts discuss high-level funding valuation but do not contribute information about investors, so they offer only partial or tangential support to the target field. Consequently, the best-supported aspect is the India presence; the investor list remains unsupported by the provided excerpts, leading to a low overall confidence about the completeness of the finegrained field value based solely on these excerpts.",

A third excerpt reiterates Harmonic's fundraising context and mentions the company's profile, which can be used to corroborate the company's private status and funding history. Together, these excerpts align with the field value's claims about Harmonic's private status, its data/AI focus, and its fundraising narrative. However, the excerpts present conflicting or incomplete totals for funding (one source cites 30M total; another suggests 100M or more), and none of the excerpts clearly confirm an India presence or address. Since the target field value asserts no India presence, the lack of explicit India-location data in these Harmonic-focused excerpts supports the \"No\" conclusion, but the inconsistencies in funding totals introduce some uncertainty. Overall, the strongest support comes from passages that identify Harmonic AI and summarize its funding context, while explicit India presence data is not provided and thus the conclusion of absence is inferred rather than directly stated.",

The note that the latest funding round occurred on Jul 26, 2022 and was a $14.8M Seed round aligns precisely with the field's last funding type, date, and total funding. Additional excerpts that state the $14.8M total and Seed round corroborate the funding narrative from multiple sources, reinforcing the data point. There are excerpts indicating other funding totals (such as $20.3M) and different rounds, which conflict with the exact figures in the field value; these serve as partial context but do not directly confirm the target combination and should not override the explicit, primary evidence of the specified seed funding of $14.8M on the stated date. The India presence is clarified in one excerpt as No, reinforced by the field value (No India presence). Other excerpts mentioning India-related information for Pogo (or related entities) provide broader context but do not match the exact no-presence assertion for this company entry, so they are less relevant to the precise field value. The combination of explicit funding amount, funding type, date, and the India-presence conclusion from multiple corroborating lines provides a reasonable basis for moderate-high confidence, though some conflicting figures in other excerpts prevent a full high-confidence settlement.",

Additional excerpts confirm the company's headquarters and location in New York, NY, including explicit statements that Chestnut Carbon is headquartered in New York, NY and address lines listing 15 Little West 12th Street, New York, NY. Several excerpts provide Chestnut Carbon's official contact information and website, reinforcing the HQ location and enabling verification of a lack of India operations on official pages. Taken together, these excerpts robustly support the field's key claims: private US-based company, Series B in 2025 with $160M of equity funding, primary investors including J.P. Morgan and CPP, US HQ in New York with NY address, and no confirmed India presence according to official materials. While some excerpts discuss earlier funding and corporate activities, the core matches—Series B funding date and amount, investor lineup, HQ location, and India presence status—are well-supported by the provided text, allowing high confidence in the field value.",

Regarding funding history, excerpts discussing Lithic funding rounds provide concrete figures for earlier rounds (a Series C round with $60 million and a Series B round with $43 million), which are relevant for reconstructing Lithic's overall funding trajectory and verifying whether the total funding could plausibly approach the claimed $110 million. These funding items inform the \"TotalFunding_USD\" and \"LastFundingDate/Type\" fields, even though they do not match the exact total and date specified in the field value. Taken together, the excerpts strongly establish India presence (contradicting the \"No India presence\" assertion) and outline Lithic's historic funding rounds, which are essential to evaluating the field value's accuracy.",

The excerpts also confirm the total funding event and investor line-up, reinforcing the context for evaluating India presence. However, none of the excerpts explicitly confirm a registered India office or GCC in India, so the absence statement cannot be fully validated from these excerpts alone; the Indian-investor linkage introduces ambiguity about whether presence is truly absent or merely not publicly documented on the company's site at this time.",

Nor is there explicit evidence within these excerpts about an Indian presence being absent; while the provided Rain sources do not mention India, there is no explicit statement confirming \"No India presence\" beyond absence of India-related evidence in these sources.

The other excerpts indicate a prior Series A round (with a value of $15 million and a 2024-era timeline) and discuss expansion plans, but they do not provide a date that matches the target value.

The most directly relevant excerpts state that the company has raised a total funding amount of 14.8 million USD and identify a Series A round around that amount, which aligns with the total funding figure. Specifically, one excerpt clearly notes a total funding of 14.8 million USD and mentions a Series A round for 14.8 million USD, directly supporting the target value. Additional excerpts corroborate the 14.8 million figure by stating the same amount in connection with funding rounds or summaries, reinforcing that the cumulative funding reached 14.8 million. There are excerpts mentioning alternative totals (e.g., 20.3 million) or different round details, which introduce potential ambiguity, but the most authoritative lines tie the 14.8 million total to the company and its Series A activity. Taken together, these excerpts provide cohesive support for the specified total funding figure and acknowledge the Series A context, reinforcing the accuracy of the field value. The linkage is: the 14.8 million total is presented alongside the latest round data, confirming both the amount and the round type, which directly validates the field value.",

Additional excerpt describing the fundraising narrative and the product tagline Earn & Save on Everything reinforces the consumer-centric, data-driven/financial interaction dimension, supporting Productivity Software, Media, or FinTech implications. Further excerpts that summarize funding histories (including multi-round activity) corroborate that the company operates in the tech/software space with multiple product lines, which is consistent with big data and SaaS interpretations. An excerpt indicating India-related presence helps place the company in a regional context but does not directly redefine the industry sectors; it is noted as supplementary context. All together, these sources cohere around a consumer/mobile app/software platform with data/earning features, mapping well to the listed industry sectors.",

Several excerpts, however, indicate that the latest (most recent) funding event was a Series A round, which would contradict the field value if the field is intended to reflect the last funding type as Seed. Therefore, the Seed-round mention is highly relevant as it confirms Seed-related activity in the funding history, while the Series A references are relevant for potential contradiction or clarification about which round is the last one. Since the field value provided is Seed Round, the Seed-round evidence is the strongest support, but the presence of explicit Series A notes reduces the certainty that Seed Round is indeed the final funding type. The combination of explicit Seed round mention plus explicit Series A latest-round notes explains why the evidence is mixed and warrants a cautious, medium confidence assessment.",

Additional excerpts corroborate the same company name and expand on funding history, including the latest funding round and amounts raised; these details help verify the identity and status of the company. A separate excerpt discusses the company's geographic presence or absence of India-related presence, which is directly relevant to the India presence criterion and the broader dataset label. By combining explicit naming with funding history and presence context, we can robustly anchor the fine-grained field value to the correct entity while noting any inconsistencies across sources regarding total funding figures or India presence.

Additional excerpts discuss U.S.-centric coverage or activity related to Chestnut Carbon (including coverage of a U.S.-based Series B round and expansion efforts in the U.S.), which supports the interpretation that the company operates from the United States, even if not stating the HQ explicitly. An excerpt noting private equity investment into the Chestnut Carbon program, while not a direct HQ statement, aligns with a U.S.-based funding ecosystem context. Remaining excerpts primarily discuss funding and corporate information without a direct HQ assertion; they provide contextual relevance but weaker support for the exact field value.

Supportive but indirect information includes the total funding figure, which helps corroborate the company's funding activity but does not confirm the specific last funding type, and an India presence note which establishes the geographic criterion but is orthogonal to the funding type.

Specifically, the PitchBook profile confirms a New York headquarters, and the contact page lists New York addresses, which strongly supports that the company's primary operations and registered presence are in the U.S. The third excerpt, duplicating the New York address information, further corroborates this US-centric presence. Since none of these sources mention India or an India-based office, they effectively support the assertion that there is no India presence.

The most relevant excerpt directly notes a presence in India via an India Office, which is highly pertinent given the field path focusing on India presence. The next most relevant excerpts confirm Lithic as a privately-held entity through notable fundraising rounds, establishing its status and growth trajectory, which are key to understanding its funding history and private status. The remaining excerpt discusses Lithic's core product offering (card issuing) and hiring activity, which, while not about India presence, still solidifies the company's identity and ongoing private-market activities. Collectively, these excerpts support that Lithic is a well-funded, active private company with relevant India-related information available.",

The most direct evidence confirming its name and private funding status comes from a TechCrunch report detailing a 160 million Series B round, and a PR Newswire release reporting the same Series B financing. Other funding-related excerpts from ESG News, a legal firm's advisory, and startup coverage corroborate the funding event and amount. Additional excerpts identify Chestnut Carbon's headquarters as New York, NY, which supports its status as a U.S.-based private company. The company's official contact page provides a New York address, further corroborating the location. Together, these sources establish Chestnut Carbon as a private, funded company with a New York headquarters, and there is no explicit indication of an India presence in these sources. Therefore, the field value is well-supported by the combination of multiple independent funding announcements and explicit HQ location details, enabling a conclusion that aligns with the India-presence field's inferred No condition (no India presence) based on the absence of any India-office indication in the cited materials.",

The most relevant excerpt explicitly mentions an 'India Office,' which directly speaks to India presence and would imply a Yes status rather than No. Other excerpts discuss Lithic's funding and business scope but do not provide information about India presence, hence they do not support or contradict the No presence claim. Therefore, the excerpt mentioning an India Office is the only directly relevant source for this fine-grained field, and it actually challenges the asserted No presence by implying there is an India office, which would indicate some form of presence. This creates a conflict between the field value and the content of the most relevant excerpt.

This makes the non-US evidence a potential counterpoint that should be considered. The remaining excerpt discusses general remote job information and does not provide HQ location information, so it is less relevant to confirming the field value. Taken together, the direct US-based descriptions provide strong support, while the India presence note challenges the exclusivity of the field value for a strict interpretation of 'without India presence'.",

These details collectively align to a coherent funding profile for Anterior, confirming that the excerpts pertain to the company name in question and help distinguish its funding history from other records. The presence of multiple corroborating data points (total funding, amount raised, date, and investors) strengthens the association between the excerpts and the target company name, making these excerpts the most relevant for validating the field value. Excerpts that include an additional data point like valuation further reinforce the context of the same funding event, though they are slightly less central than the core funding figures and date. Overall, the excerpts jointly support identifying Anterior as the subject of the field value, establishing a consistent funding narrative for that company.",

Because the field value enumerates additional investors beyond NEA that are not mentioned in the excerpts, those portions cannot be confirmed or refuted by the provided text. Consequently, the most direct support comes from the mention of NEA, with secondary support from the total funding amount and funding date as context for the round in which that investor participated. There is no direct evidence in these excerpts for Sequoia Capital, Blue Lion Global, Neo, Mustafa Suleyman, Darian Shirazi, Anamcara Capital, ODDBIRD VC, or Four Acres Capital, so their inclusion remains unverified based on the excerpts provided.",

The most relevant excerpt explicitly references a venture investor, Bessemer Venture Partners, in the context of a funding round (Series B). This directly supports the notion that private investors are part of the company's funding history, aligning with the expected key_investors field. A second excerpt describes a larger funding round (Series C) for Lithic, which is consistent with a multi-round funding narrative and suggests there are multiple investors involved, even if not all are named in that snippet. Other excerpts provide context about the company's product (card issuing platform) or a statement about India presence, which does not directly enumerate investors and thus is less relevant to the specific field value. Collectively, these excerpts support the idea that Lithic has a set of notable venture investors, with Bessemer Venture Partners clearly identified and other investors likely present given the funding rounds described. Therefore, the most relevant evidence centers on explicit investor mentions, followed by corroborating funding round information, and finally contextual company/product details.",

This supports the notion that the last funding occurred in 2024 and within a mid-year window. Additional excerpts provide explicit funding totals (e.g., total funding amount and rounds) and investor information, which corroborate that there was a meaningful funding event in the same period, reinforcing the likelihood of a 2024 funding activity. Although none of the excerpts state the exact day 2024-06-08, the combination of a June 2024 date and substantial funding figures collectively supports the inference that the last funding date falls in mid-2024, closely matching the target value. The presence of a July- or later-month indicator is not evident, which keeps the date within a plausible June 2024 timeframe. These pieces together form a cohesive alignment to the requested field value, with stronger weight given to the explicit month/year clue and supplementary funding data.",

This exact figure matches the field value being analyzed, making it the strongest piece of evidence. Another excerpt mentions an amount raised of 20 million USD, which conflicts with the 23.2 million figure and introduces ambiguity about the precise total funding. Additional excerpts provide context for the funding round (the date of June 2024) and details about the round in which NEA appears as a lead investor, and a separate note about the post-money valuation. While these do not directly confirm the exact total funding amount, they corroborate that the company has undergone a funded round and provide a richer funding context, which helps validate the overall funding narrative but not the exact numeric value of 23.2 million. In sum, the exact 23.2 million figure is supported by the explicit statement of total funding, while a conflicting 20 million figure introduces a discrepancy that reduces absolute certainty.

This is the closest to the target date and amount in 2025, and it informs the likely recent funding activity, though it does not specify the date. The next excerpt confirms a Series A funding in November 2022 amounting to USD 23 million, which establishes a clear prior funding event and helps place historical funding cadence but does not align with the target date. It also provides the explicit Series A label and the investor context, which supports the interpretation of Harmonic AI's funding history, including a Series A round that could be multiple years prior to 2025. The remaining excerpt notes a total funding of $30M across two rounds, with the latest round labeled as Series A, and mentions the first funding round occurred in 2021. This reinforces the existence of multiple rounds and provides a timeline context, but it does not verify the exact 2025-07-10 date. Overall, none of the excerpts confirm the precise date 2025-07-10; instead they collectively illustrate ongoing funding activity into 2025 and prior rounds, which suggests that the exact date is not supported by the excerpts given.

These excerpts confirm that NewLimit is privately funded and has completed a significant funding round, which supports the existence of substantial total funding and a recent Series-style round, aligning with the target field's intent to capture total funding and the most recent round. However, the target field specifies a total funding of 170 million and a last funding date of 2025-05-06 with a Series B designation and a list of investors. The provided excerpts explicitly state 130 million as the funding amount and do not specify a date of 2025-05-06 nor explicitly label the round as Series B within the text shown; this introduces a discrepancy between the field value and the available excerpts. Regarding India presence, the target field asserts No presence with a precise-phrasing note about no evidence of an office or operations in India. The NewLimit excerpts do not contain any information about India offices or addresses, so there is no direct evidence confirming presence or absence within these sources. Therefore, the excerpts strongly support the existence of a substantial private funding event for NewLimit and provide a concrete funding amount and date, but they do not fully corroborate the exact numeric total funding, the precise last funding date, or the Series B labeling as stated in the field value. They also do not provide India presence information, so the No presence conclusion relies on the absence of India-related details in these sources rather than a direct citation within them.",
