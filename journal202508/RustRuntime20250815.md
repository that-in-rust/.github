# RustRuntime20250815

## Governing Thought
- **Objective**: The RustHallows project aims to achieve significant performance improvements (10-40x) by reimagining the software stack from hardware isolation up to domain-specific languages (DSLs).

## Key Supporting Points
- **Real-time Partition OS**: Provides hardware-level isolation and deterministic, low-latency communication primitives.
- **Optimized Schedulers**: Tailored for different application types (Backend APIs, UI rendering, Database, Messaging).
- **Customized Applications and Frameworks**: Includes a backend framework inspired by Ruby on Rails, a UI framework inspired by React, and databases for OLAP and OLTP.
- **Customized DSLs**: Parseltongue, a declarative, macro-driven DSL, unifies the stack.

## Unique Ideas
- **Vertical Integration**: Rust-centric ecosystem for multiplicative performance gains.
- **Game Theory in Scheduling**: Use of Nash equilibria for resource allocation.
- **Bio-Inspired Resilience**: Incorporating mycology and quantum mechanics concepts for system resilience and optimization.
