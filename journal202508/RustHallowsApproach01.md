- how can we write Rust code for both no_std and std with worst free LLM help?
    - if architecture options are clear enough
    - if idiomatic pattern reference files are SOTA
    - if we can use TDD as the driving force
-  which app-specific-real-time-partitioned-kernel can offer a clear differentiation?
    - Data Ecosystem for aggregation
        - Kafka-inspired tool with Scala language : 10/10
        - Data Lake 
        - Spark PySpark
    - UI : 2 / 10
    - Backend API : 6/10
    - Cache
    - OpenSearch or Elastic Search
    - Logging
    - Database : 
    - Load Balancers :
    - Streaming
    - Web Socket
    - WebRTC
    - GraphQL
    - protobuf
- what will create differentiation?
