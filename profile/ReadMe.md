# that-in-rust

Welcome to that-in-rust! We are a group of developers passionate about building useful tools in Rust.


## Our Mission

We believe in the power of Rust for creating efficient, reliable, and maintainable software. Our organization focuses on developing practical utilities that solve real-world problems while showcasing Rust's capabilities in & beyond systems programming.

## Our Key Projects

- [tweet-scrolls](https://github.com/that-in-rust/tweet-scrolls) - Convert your Twitter archive into scrolls, where all your multi-tweet threads are stored in a single header in a txt file
- [txt-sectumsempra](https://github.com/that-in-rust/txt-sectumsempra) - Divide a text file into multiple chunks
- [zip-revelio](https://github.com/that-in-rust/zip-revelio) - Analyze your zip files like GitHub repo zips without opening them
- [vscode-lumos](https://github.com/that-in-rust/vscode-lumos) - A VS Code extension that highlights Java and Rust code blocks in text files

## Why Rust?

Rust offers an exceptional combination of performance, safety, and developer experience. While often associated with systems programming, we're demonstrating how Rust can excel in building everyday tools and utilities that developers need.

As the Stack Overflow survey has shown for multiple years, Rust is beloved by developers for good reason - its powerful compiler acts like a helpful pair-programmer, guiding you toward better code.

## Ideation framework

1. Product Market Fit of a functionality is proven in another language ecosystem, and it can be ported to the Rust ecosystem, e.g. gofmt -> rustfmt

2. Product Market Fit of a library is proven, but the library could be rewritten in Rust for improved efficiency, efficacy & feature coverage
