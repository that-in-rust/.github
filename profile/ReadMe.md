# that-in-rust

Welcome to that-in-rust! We are a group of developers passionate about building useful tools in Rust.


## Our Mission

We believe in the power of Rust for creating efficient, reliable, and maintainable software. Our organization focuses on developing practical utilities that solve real-world problems while showcasing Rust's capabilities in & beyond systems programming.

Right now it is just me amuldotexe - sheetalssr - and LLMs doing this - if you wanna join - DM us somewhere but we basically do not need anyone - just maybe LLM token donations are enough
