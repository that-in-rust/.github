# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature creates a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for AI assistants (Kiro LLM or Windsurf) to consolidate Rust Open Source CSE research from multiple document formats into two primary outputs: (1) A comprehensive table of ideas/observations/insights without source attribution, focusing on capturing ALL interesting thoughts across documents, and (2) A table of unique URLs with context about their relevance to the research themes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to specify a folder containing my research documents, so that I can consolidate all my findings into a single organized document.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide a folder path THEN the system SHALL accept both relative and absolute paths
2. WHEN the folder contains mixed file formats (txt, json, md, doc, pdf) THEN the system SHALL process all supported formats
3. IF the folder path is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messaging
4. WHEN processing begins THEN the system SHALL validate folder accessibility before proceeding

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the AI assistant to process large documents incrementally using LLM analysis, so that I can handle files of any size while maintaining intelligent content understanding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing any document THEN the AI assistant SHALL read content in 100-line chunks using terminal commands
2. WHEN a file is larger than 100 lines THEN the AI assistant SHALL iterate through all chunks and maintain context across chunks
3. WHEN using terminal commands like pandoc THEN the AI assistant SHALL handle different file formats and analyze content semantically
4. IF a file cannot be processed THEN the AI assistant SHALL log the error and continue with remaining files
5. WHEN analyzing chunks THEN the AI assistant SHALL maintain running context of ideas and themes across the entire document

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the AI assistant to create a comprehensive table of all interesting ideas and insights without source attribution, so that I can see the full breadth of concepts across all documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing content THEN the AI assistant SHALL extract ALL interesting technical concepts, architectural patterns, and insights
2. WHEN similar ideas are found THEN the AI assistant SHALL merge them into comprehensive entries without tracking which documents contributed
3. WHEN creating table entries THEN the AI assistant SHALL focus on technical details, performance claims, and implementation approaches
4. WHEN organizing ideas THEN the AI assistant SHALL categorize by domain (Real-Time OS, Browser Engine, AI Inference, etc.)
5. WHEN consolidating THEN the AI assistant SHALL prioritize completeness over source traceability

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want all relevant URLs preserved with context about their relevance, so that I can access supporting resources for the research themes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing documents THEN the system SHALL extract and preserve all unique URLs found in content
2. WHEN collecting URLs THEN the system SHALL note the context and relevance of each URL
3. WHEN generating output THEN the system SHALL create a separate URLs table with context explanations
4. WHEN multiple documents contain the same URL THEN the system SHALL deduplicate and provide comprehensive context

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the consolidated document generated in the journalSummary2025 folder, so that it's organized with my other summary materials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN consolidation is complete THEN the system SHALL create the output file in the specified journalSummary2025 directory
2. WHEN the output directory doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL create it automatically
3. WHEN generating the filename THEN the system SHALL include timestamp and descriptive naming
4. IF the target file already exists THEN the system SHALL either append or create a versioned filename

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the system to work as a reusable SOP with context handoff capabilities, so that I can apply this process across multiple LLM sessions and different research folders over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the SOP THEN the system SHALL prompt for the source folder path
2. WHEN I specify different folders THEN the system SHALL process each independently
3. WHEN the process completes THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of what was processed
4. WHEN I want to rerun the process THEN the system SHALL be easily executable without modification
5. WHEN context limits are reached THEN the system SHALL provide clear handoff instructions for continuation
6. WHEN resuming in a new LLM thread THEN the system SHALL enable quick state recovery and seamless continuation

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the consolidated document to be well-structured and readable, so that I can easily navigate and reference the consolidated research.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating output THEN the system SHALL organize content into logical sections
2. WHEN presenting ideas THEN the system SHALL use clear markdown formatting with headers and lists
3. WHEN including references THEN the system SHALL format them consistently
4. WHEN the document is complete THEN it SHALL include a table of contents for easy navigation

### Requirements Update

- **Direct Terminal Processing:**
  - Avoid creating intermediate files during research consolidation.
  - Use commands like `awk`, `grep`, and `head` directly in the terminal for efficient processing.
