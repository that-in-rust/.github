# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature provides a Git workflow automation CLI tool that performs atomic union merges of multiple feature branches into the main branch. The system eliminates the manual overhead of sequential branch merging by executing a single command that intelligently consolidates all development work while preserving code integrity, commit history, and team attribution.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Union Merge Execution

**User Story:** As a developer working on a project with 5-20 active feature branches, I want to execute a single command that merges all branches into main in under 30 seconds, so that I can eliminate the 15-45 minutes typically spent on manual sequential merging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user executes `git union-merge` in a repository with N branches THEN the system SHALL complete the operation in O(N) time complexity
2. WHEN the command runs THEN the system SHALL identify exactly all local and remote tracking branches excluding main/master/develop
3. WHEN analyzing branches THEN the system SHALL detect merge conflicts between any two branches within 5 seconds per branch pair
4. WHEN creating the final merge THEN the system SHALL produce exactly one merge commit with all branch changes integrated
5. IF any single branch fails to merge THEN the system SHALL continue processing remaining branches and report failures in structured JSON format

### Requirement 2: Risk Assessment and Preview

**User Story:** As a tech lead managing a team of 3-8 developers, I want to see exactly which files will be modified and which conflicts require manual resolution before executing the union merge, so that I can prevent breaking changes from reaching main without spending more than 2 minutes on review.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user executes `git union-merge --dry-run` THEN the system SHALL display a structured report showing exactly: branch count, file modification count, conflict count, and estimated merge time
2. WHEN previewing conflicts THEN the system SHALL categorize each conflict as: AUTO_RESOLVABLE, MANUAL_REQUIRED, or BLOCKING and show the exact file paths and line numbers
3. WHEN displaying the preview THEN the system SHALL show the proposed merge commit message with all branch names and commit counts
4. WHEN the user confirms with `--execute` flag THEN the system SHALL proceed only if the repository state matches the preview analysis
5. IF the repository state changed since preview THEN the system SHALL abort and require a fresh preview

### Requirement 3: Intelligent Conflict Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer working with 80% routine conflicts (whitespace, imports, non-overlapping changes), I want the system to auto-resolve these conflicts with 99.9% accuracy, so that I only spend time on the 20% of conflicts that genuinely need human judgment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conflicts involve only whitespace differences THEN the system SHALL auto-resolve using the project's configured formatter (prettier, rustfmt, etc.) within 100ms per file
2. WHEN conflicts involve non-overlapping code sections in the same file THEN the system SHALL merge both changes and validate syntax correctness
3. WHEN identical changes exist across multiple branches THEN the system SHALL deduplicate to exactly one instance and log the deduplication
4. WHEN conflicts involve overlapping logic changes THEN the system SHALL flag as MANUAL_REQUIRED and provide 3-way diff visualization
5. IF auto-resolution fails syntax validation THEN the system SHALL revert to manual resolution mode and log the failure reason

### Requirement 4: Branch Filtering and Policy Configuration

**User Story:** As a team lead with branches following naming conventions (feature/*, hotfix/*, release/*), I want to configure exactly which branch patterns participate in union merges and set team-specific merge policies, so that I can ensure only appropriate branches are merged without manual branch selection each time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring via `.git-union-merge.json` THEN the system SHALL support regex patterns for include/exclude branch filtering with validation
2. WHEN multiple patterns match a branch THEN the system SHALL apply the most specific pattern and log the decision
3. WHEN setting merge strategies THEN the system SHALL support per-file-type merge strategies (e.g., "ours" for package-lock.json, "recursive" for source code)
4. WHEN a branch matches exclusion criteria THEN the system SHALL skip it and log the reason in the operation summary
5. IF no configuration exists THEN the system SHALL use safe defaults: include feature/* and bugfix/*, exclude release/* and hotfix/*

### Requirement 5: History Preservation and Attribution

**User Story:** As a developer who needs to track code ownership for debugging and code reviews, I want the union merge to preserve complete commit history and author attribution, so that `git blame` and `git log` remain fully functional after the merge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the union merge commit THEN the system SHALL preserve all individual commits as parents in the merge commit graph
2. WHEN merging THEN the system SHALL maintain original author, committer, and timestamp for every commit
3. WHEN generating the merge commit message THEN the system SHALL include: branch names, commit counts per branch, and conflict resolution summary
4. WHEN the operation completes THEN the system SHALL create a git tag `union-merge-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` pointing to the merge commit
5. IF configured for branch cleanup THEN the system SHALL delete merged branches only after confirming the merge commit contains all their changes

### Requirement 6: Atomic Rollback and Recovery

**User Story:** As a developer who discovers issues after a union merge (broken tests, missing changes), I want to rollback the entire operation to the exact pre-merge state within 10 seconds, so that I can quickly recover without losing any work or requiring repository re-cloning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting a union merge THEN the system SHALL create a recovery checkpoint storing: HEAD SHA, branch refs, and stash state
2. WHEN executing `git union-merge --rollback` THEN the system SHALL restore the repository to the exact pre-merge state within 10 seconds
3. WHEN rolling back THEN the system SHALL restore all deleted branches to their original commit SHAs and restore any stashed changes
4. WHEN rollback completes THEN the system SHALL verify repository integrity and provide a success confirmation with restored branch count
5. IF rollback encounters conflicts THEN the system SHALL provide manual recovery commands and preserve the recovery checkpoint for debugging
