| **Cloud Cost Optimization** | Migrating from Ruby on Rails to Rust | 70-90% reduction in compute-related cloud costs; Rust enables 10-15x throughput and 8-10x lower memory per process | Dramatic infrastructure savings, improved unit economics, better user experience, ESG benefits | ARM-based cloud instances (AWS Graviton) amplify savings; phased migration recommended |
| **Performance Density** | Request Throughput Optimization | Rust: 180k-220k req/s vs Rails: 12k-18k req/s; 9-11x improvement for CRUD workloads | Single Rust instance replaces 10 Rails instances; linear scaling impact | Axum framework, ARM instances provide additional 45% cost savings |
| **Memory Efficiency** | RSS Footprint Reduction | Rust: 25-40MB vs Rails: 220-300MB per worker process | 8-10x lighter memory footprint enables smaller VMs, higher container density | Vertical rightsizing and increased container density |
| **CPU Utilization** | Computational Efficiency | Rust uses 40% of 1 core vs Rails saturating 2 full cores | Enables smaller vCPU instances, proportional cost reduction | ARM processors provide additional energy efficiency |
| **Auto-Scaling Precision** | Efficiency Cascade Effect | More aggressive scaling thresholds due to higher per-instance capacity | Reduces idle resource waste, minimizes warm buffer costs | Systemic improvement compounds savings across stages |
| **Instance Family Optimization** | Cloud Resource Right-Sizing | Shift from memory-optimized to compute-optimized instances | Different pricing structures unlock additional savings | r5.large → c6g.large migration patterns |
| **Pricing Strategy** | Cloud Procurement Models | On-demand, Reserved, Savings Plans, Spot | 45-90% cost reduction through commitment | Balance flexibility vs. savings |
| **Sustainability** | ARM Energy Efficiency | ARM instances use up to 60% less energy for same performance | Reduces carbon footprint, aligns with ESG goals | AWS Graviton, GCP Tau T2A, Azure ARM VMs |
| **Migration Risk** | Strategic Discounting Mismatch | Cloud financial commitments (RIs/Savings Plans) can erase savings if migration is mistimed | Must align migration timeline with contract expiration | Engineering, Finance, and FinOps must coordinate |
| **Migration Strategy** | Phased Implementation Roadmap | Pilot, foundational investment, scaled migration; use "strangler fig" pattern | De-risk migration, validate assumptions, build momentum | Start with non-critical microservices, train team, align contracts |
| **Break-Even Analysis** | Investment vs. Savings | Payback period = Total investment / Monthly operational savings | Quantifies migration ROI, guides decision-making | Example: $450k investment, $36k/month savings, 12.5 month payback |
