# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Process all markdown files from /home/amuldotexe/Downloads/zzRustResearch
  - Process 172 .md files using head/tail commands in 100-line chunks
  - Extract ALL interesting technical concepts, ideas, and insights from each file
  - Add entries to Ideas & Insights Table without source attribution
  - Collect URLs and add to URLs Table with context
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.5, 3.1, 4.1_

- [ ] 2. Process all text files from /home/amuldotexe/Downloads/zzRustResearch
  - Process 91 .txt files using head/tail commands in 100-line chunks
  - Extract unique research insights and technical details for Ideas Table
  - Semantically merge with existing ideas without tracking sources
  - Extract and deduplicate URLs with relevance context
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2, 4.1_

- [ ] 3. Process all JSON files from /home/amuldotexe/Downloads/zzRustResearch
  - Process 24 .json files to extract structured research data
  - Parse JSON for insights, analysis results, and technical specifications
  - Add comprehensive entries to Ideas Table focusing on completeness
  - Extract URLs and add context about their relevance to research themes
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 3.1, 3.5, 4.2_

- [ ] 4. Process all PDF/DOC files from /home/amuldotexe/Downloads/zzRustResearch
  - Convert 150 PDF/DOC files to text using pandoc
  - Process converted content in 100-line chunks for comprehensive analysis
  - Extract research concepts and merge into Ideas Table without source tracking
  - Handle conversion errors gracefully and continue with remaining files
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 2.4, 3.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 5. Perform semantic deduplication and consolidation
  - Analyze all extracted ideas for semantic similarity across all file types
  - Merge related concepts into comprehensive entries without source attribution
  - Organize ideas by categories (Real-Time OS, Browser Engine, AI Inference, etc.)
  - Finalize URLs Table with unique URLs and comprehensive context
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.4, 3.5_

- [ ] 6. Generate final two-table consolidated document
  - Create Ideas & Insights Table with comprehensive coverage of all concepts
  - Create URLs Table with unique URLs and relevance context
  - Include executive summary of key research themes
  - Ensure proper markdown formatting for both tables
  - Save to journalSummary2025 folder with timestamp
  - _Requirements: 4.3, 5.1, 5.3, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4_

## Context Handoff Support

### Multi-Session Continuation
- **State Recovery**: Use bash commands to check current progress and remaining files
- **Seamless Handoff**: Any LLM can continue work by reading current consolidated document
- **Progress Tracking**: Target 50-100+ Ideas entries, 30-50+ URLs entries from 439 total files
- **Quality Maintenance**: Preserve no-source-attribution approach across sessions
- **Completion Criteria**: All file types processed, semantic deduplication complete
