## GitHub URLs for the exemplary projects

Note: Many of these are mirrors and may not contain full pre‑2010 history. I’ve noted common caveats.

-  Linux kernel
    - https://github.com/torvalds/linux
    - Caveat: Authoritative history is on kernel.org; GitHub mirror maintained by Linus but issues/PRs not used.

-  GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
    - https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc
    - Caveat: Read-only mirror; canonical is on GCC’s infrastructure/Sourceware.

-  binutils
    - https://github.com/bminor/binutils-gdb
    - Caveat: Mirror of Sourceware binutils+gdb monorepo.

-  glibc
    - https://github.com/bminor/glibc
    - Caveat: Mirror; canonical on Sourceware.

-  CPython (Python)
    - https://github.com/python/cpython
    - Caveat: Canonical now on GitHub, but early history was migrated; pre‑2000s history may be summarized.

-  PostgreSQL
    - https://github.com/postgres/postgres
    - Caveat: Official mirror; canonical is git.postgresql.org.

-  SQLite
    - https://github.com/sqlite/sqlite
    - Caveat: Auto‑generated from Fossil; canonical is sqlite.org/src.

-  OpenBSD / OpenSSH
    - OpenBSD src (unofficial mirror): https://github.com/openbsd/src
    - OpenSSH portable (official portable repo): https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable
    - Caveat: OpenBSD canonical is CVS; mirrors may be incomplete.

-  Apache httpd
    - https://github.com/apache/httpd
    - Caveat: Official Apache Git mirror; older SVN history migrated.

-  Nginx
    - https://github.com/nginx/nginx
    - Caveat: Official mirror; canonical is hg/git on nginx.org; history before certain points may be partial.

-  FFmpeg
    - https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg
    - Caveat: Official Git repo hosted on GitHub now; early history migrated from their own servers.

-  Git (the VCS)
    - https://github.com/git/git
    - Caveat: Official; also mirrored on kernel.org.

-  Emacs
    - https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs
    - Caveat: Mirror from GNU Savannah; canonical is savannah.gnu.org.

-  Vim
    - https://github.com/vim/vim
    - Caveat: Official now hosted on GitHub; older pre‑2010 tags exist but earlier CVS history may be summarized.

-  WebKit
    - https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit
    - Caveat: Official mirror; canonical is on WebKit’s own Git server.

-  Mozilla / Firefox (mozilla-central)
    - https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev
    - Caveat: Read-only mirror of mozilla‑central (Mercurial); large, but some metadata differs from hg.

-  Sourceware combined binutils+gdb:
    - https://github.com/bminor/binutils-gdb

If you want, I can produce a script that pulls from these GitHub URLs into your PensieveDB01 folder, with notes on how to check out pre‑2010 tags/commits where they exist.
