    "executive_summary": "The objective of this project is to compile a definitive dataset of the top 2,000 most-trafficked websites in the United States (US) and the European Union (EU), ranked by estimated unique monthly visitors (MUV) for the most recent full year. The methodology involved a comprehensive evaluation of data providers like Similarweb, Semrush, and Comscore. The research established that while MUV data is available via paid APIs, it is not present in free public rankings, which typically use 'total visits'. The final methodology for dataset creation involves several key steps: 1) Sourcing country-level MUV data from a selected primary provider (SEMrush is recommended for its cost-effectiveness and direct API). 2) Canonicalizing all domains to their registrable root using the Public Suffix List (PSL) to ensure consistent aggregation. 3) Applying strict exclusion rules to filter out non-content domains such as CDNs, parked pages, and malicious sites. 4) For the EU list, aggregating MUV data by summing the figures from each of the 27 member states, with the explicit and critical caveat that this represents a 'gross audience estimate' and not a deduplicated figure, thus likely overestimating the true audience. 5) Enriching the core data with parent company attribution, website category, primary monetization model, and parent company headquarters country, based on defined, repeatable protocols. Key findings from the research indicate that a true, deduplicated EU-wide MUV list is not available from any single provider, making the aggregation approach a necessary but methodologically imperfect compromise. Furthermore, all major data providers have highly restrictive terms of service that prohibit the redistribution or publication of their data without explicit written consent and specific attribution.",

      "provider_name": "Semrush",
      "suitability_analysis": "Semrush is the most suitable provider for this project due to its efficient and cost-effective API. Its '/analytics/ta/api/v3/rank' endpoint directly provides a ranked list of top domains by country, including a specific field for 'users' which maps directly to the required Monthly Unique Visitors (MUV) metric. This one-step process is significantly more efficient than the alternative, Similarweb, which requires a cumbersome and expensive two-step process: first retrieving a list of top domains (which does not include MUV) and then making individual API calls for each of the 2,000 domains to get their MUV data. Comscore is deemed unsuitable as its API is designed for ad campaign validation, not general domain ranking, and its MUV metric is limited to PC traffic. While Semrush's API access requires a subscription and a separate purchase of the '.Trends' add-on, its API unit model is highly cost-effective for this specific task, making it the recommended primary source.",
      "metric_availability": "Semrush's Traffic Analytics API provides a clear distinction between 'Visits' (total sessions) and 'Unique Visitors' (distinct users). The required metric, estimated unique monthly visitors (MUV), is directly available through the API by requesting the 'users' field in the 'export_columns' parameter of an API call. This is available for 190 countries, including the US and all EU member states, allowing for the necessary data collection for both target regions. While Similarweb also offers a 'Unique Visitors' metric based on its contributory network, accessing it is more complex and costly. Comscore provides a 'Unique Visitors' metric through its Media MetrixÂ® suite, which is highly regarded for its deduplicated, person-centric view, but access is not available through a public-facing, self-serve API suitable for this project's scale.",
      "api_and_cost_details": "Semrush offers access through its .Trends API, specifically the 'Traffic Rank' endpoint (`/analytics/ta/api/v3/rank`). This endpoint allows for bulk analysis of up to 200 domains per request. To retrieve the top 2,000 domains for one country for one month, only 10 API calls are needed. The pricing model is based on API units, with each request costing 1 unit. Therefore, retrieving a full year of data for the US would cost only 120 API units (10 calls/month * 12 months). While this requires a subscription (e.g., a 'business' plan at ~$499/month) and the '.Trends' add-on, the API unit consumption is very low. In contrast, Similarweb's API operates on a more expensive 'data credits' model. Retrieving the same data from Similarweb would require approximately 48,000 data credits for a full year, making it significantly more costly. Comscore's pricing is enterprise-level, starting at $90,000 annually, placing it outside the likely budget for this project.",
      "licensing_and_redistribution": "Semrush's Terms of Service (effective November 4, 2024) state that all services and data are for the user's 'internal business purposes only'. The terms explicitly prohibit sublicensing, reselling, commercially exploiting, or making the services available to any third party without prior written consent. The Content Policy reinforces that Semrush Content cannot be copied, reproduced, or distributed unless specifically authorized. Therefore, publishing the final 4,000-row CSV dataset derived from Semrush data would constitute a breach of the standard license agreement. Such an action would require negotiating a specific commercial or redistribution license directly with Semrush, which would likely involve additional costs and specific attribution requirements."

    "metric_definition_and_ranking_methodology": {
      "primary_metric_definition": "The primary ranking metric is 'Estimated Unique Monthly Visitors' (MUV), defined as the average number of distinct individuals who visit an analyzed domain within a calendar month. An individual user is counted only once, regardless of how many times they visit the site during that month. This metric measures audience reach rather than total visit volume. The methodology is based on unique device IDs from a provider's contributory network (e.g., Similarweb's approach), which avoids reliance on browser cookies that are prone to deletion and can lead to overestimation of unique visitors. The total MUV for a domain is the sum of its unique visitors from desktop and mobile web, noting that these are typically not deduplicated across devices by the provider.",
      "year_window_selection": "The ranking is based on data from the 'most recent full year,' which is defined as the most recently completed calendar year. For example, for a report generated on August 20, 2025, the relevant time window is January 1, 2024, to December 31, 2024. The final MUV score used for ranking is calculated as the arithmetic average of the 12 monthly MUV figures within that specified calendar year.",
      "ranking_logic": "Websites within each target region (US and EU) are sorted in descending order based on their calculated average 'Estimated Unique Monthly Visitors' (MUV) for the selected full-year window. The domain with the highest average MUV is ranked #1, the second highest is ranked #2, and so on, down to the 2,000th position.",
      "tie_breaking_rules": "In cases where two or more domains have an identical average MUV for the year, a deterministic, multi-level tie-breaking procedure is applied in the following strict order: 1. The domain with the higher average number of pages viewed per visit during the year window is ranked higher. 2. If a tie persists, the domain with the longer average visit duration during the year window is ranked higher. 3. If a tie still persists after applying both secondary metrics, the domains are ranked in ascending alphabetical order based on their canonicalized domain name (A-Z)."
    },
    "eu_data_aggregation_methodology": {
      "aggregation_method": "The EU MUV score is calculated by creating a master list of all unique domains found across the 27 EU member states and, for each domain, summing its MUV from every EU country in which it appears. For example, if a domain has 1 million MUV in Germany and 500,000 MUV in France, its aggregated score would be 1.5 million. The final EU ranking is based on the 12-month average of this summed monthly figure. This pragmatic approach is necessary due to the lack of a direct, deduplicated EU-wide MUV metric from providers.",
      "list_of_eu_countries": "The aggregation is performed across all 27 member states of the European Union (as of February 1, 2020): Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden.",
      "key_limitation_and_caveat": "The critical limitation of this aggregation method is the lack of cross-country user deduplication. A single user who visits a website from multiple EU countries (e.g., from Germany and France in the same month) will be counted as a unique visitor in each country's dataset, leading to double-counting in the final sum. Therefore, the resulting EU MUV figure is an upper-bound estimate of the true unique audience and must be explicitly understood as a 'sum of MUVs reported in each country,' not a deduplicated EU-wide MUV.",
      "data_gap_handling": "In cases where MUV data for a specific domain is unavailable in smaller EU countries or for less popular sites, the most transparent and practical approach is to treat the missing value as zero for the purpose of the summation. While statistical imputation methods exist, treating gaps as zero avoids introducing further estimation errors into an already estimated metric and acknowledges the data limitations in the final analysis."

      "canonicalization_method": "All domains will be canonicalized to their registrable root domain, also known as the effective Top-Level Domain plus one label (eTLD+1). This process is executed using the Public Suffix List (PSL), a comprehensive, community-maintained list of all known public suffixes (e.g., .com, .co.uk, .pvt.k12.ma.us). The PSL algorithm is applied to each domain to identify its public suffix and extract the registrable domain (e.g., 'example.co.uk' from 'www.blog.example.co.uk'), ensuring that all subdomains are aggregated under a single parent entity for ranking.",
      "subdomain_handling_rule": "While search engines generally treat subdomains as separate entities, for the purpose of this ranking, traffic is aggregated to the eTLD+1 parent. A critical exception applies to user-generated content platforms like blogspot.com or github.io. The Public Suffix List contains wildcard rules for these platforms (e.g., '*.blogspot.com'), which designates the platform domain itself as a public suffix. Consequently, a user's site like 'my-unique-blog.blogspot.com' is treated as its own distinct eTLD+1. Therefore, traffic for 'user1.blogspot.com' and 'user2.blogspot.com' is counted for two separate entities, not aggregated under 'blogspot.com'.",
      "idn_handling_rule": "To ensure technical consistency and compatibility with DNS, all Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs) containing non-ASCII characters must be converted to their Punycode representation. This is done using the 'ToASCII' operation as defined by the IDNA2008 standard (RFC 5890, 5891). For example, the domain 'fÃ³o.com' is converted to its ASCII-Compatible Encoding (ACE) string 'xn--fo-5ja.com' for all processing and analysis.",
      "exclusion_criteria": "A comprehensive list of domain types will be excluded from the final ranking to ensure data quality. This includes: 1) Malicious and Phishing Sites, identified by checking against reputable blocklists like the Google Safe Browsing API. 2) Parked Domains, which are registered but have no unique content, identified using heuristics that analyze page content and ad density. 3) Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), such as Akamai, Cloudflare, and AWS CloudFront, which are infrastructure providers, not destination sites. 4) Error Hosts, which consistently return high rates of HTTP errors. 5) Service and Infrastructure Domains, including AMP Cache domains (e.g., cdn.ampproject.org) and tracking/analytics domains identified via lists like DuckDuckGo's Tracker Radar."

The primary definition is derived from IFRS 10, which defines a parent as an entity that 'controls' an investee based on having power, exposure to variable returns, and the ability to use its power to affect those returns. This is supplemented by the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) definition of an 'ultimate accounting consolidating parent' as the highest-level legal entity that prepares consolidated financial statements for a group. This ensures the entity at the very top of the corporate hierarchy, which is not controlled by any other entity, is identified.",
      "primary_data_sources": "A multi-source approach is used to ensure accuracy. The hierarchy of sources is: 1) Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) Level 2 'Who Owns Whom' data, which directly identifies ultimate parents. 2) Public company filings with securities regulators, such as the US SEC EDGAR database, where annual 10-K reports contain an 'Exhibit 21' listing all significant subsidiaries. 3) National and regional business registries, such as the UK's Companies House, which provides data on 'People with Significant Control (PSCs)'. 4) OpenCorporates, a large open database of corporate structures. 5) Legal disclosures on the websites themselves (e.g., 'Impressum' in Germany, 'mentions lÃ©gales' in France) to link a URL to a legal entity.",
      "primary_identifier_used": "To ensure unambiguous identification of corporate entities globally, the primary identifier used is the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI). The LEI is a 20-character, alpha-numeric code based on the ISO 17442 standard, connecting to key reference information that enables clear and unique identification of legal entities participating in financial transactions. The OpenCorporates ID is used as a valuable secondary identifier due to its extensive coverage.",
      "acquisition_handling_rule": "All parent company attributions must be current as of the specified report date of 2025-08-20. To ensure this, the methodology includes a process for continuously monitoring and incorporating all relevant Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A) and divestiture activities that have been completed up to this date. This is achieved by tracking official sources such as company press releases, investor relations updates, and regulatory filings (e.g., SEC filings) to update ownership relationships in the dataset."

The primary sources are the company's own official disclosures, including: 1) Annual Reports (e.g., 10-K, 20-F), which under accounting standards like IAS 1 must disclose the country of incorporation and address of the principal place of business. 2) Investor Relations (IR) websites. These are corroborated by secondary official sources, including: 3) The Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) database, which contains 'HeadquartersAddress' fields with a mandatory ISO country code. 4) National business registries like the US SEC EDGAR and UK Companies House.",
      "disambiguation_rule": "In cases of conflicting information, such as a company with dual headquarters or a registered office in one country and operational headquarters in another, the OECD's definition of the Ultimate Parent Entity (UPE) from the BEPS Action 13 report is the definitive tie-breaker. The UPE is the entity required to prepare Consolidated Financial Statements under the accounting principles of its jurisdiction of tax residence. Therefore, the UPE's jurisdiction of tax residence is designated as the official CompanyHQ_Country, as this reflects the ultimate center of financial control.",
      "holding_company_treatment": "The methodology specifically addresses the common use of holding companies located in favorable tax jurisdictions. The OECD's UPE definition is applied, which focuses on the ultimate consolidating entity in the corporate structure. The CompanyHQ_Country is assigned based on the country of tax residence for this ultimate holding company, as it is the entity at the apex of the ownership chain responsible for preparing the group's consolidated financial statements, regardless of where the group's primary operations are located."

This standard is widely adopted across the digital advertising industry and provides a common, granular language for describing website content, which is essential for contextual analysis and brand safety. The final category list is a synthesis of this standard with the category structures used by major analytics providers like Google and Similarweb to ensure broad compatibility and relevance.",
      "automated_labeling_approach": "Websites are automatically classified using a multi-signal, model-based approach. The classification engine analyzes a variety of signals, including: 1) Content Analysis: Crawling and analyzing text from page titles, meta descriptions, and body content to identify keywords and topics. 2) Structured Data: Parsing embedded Schema.org structured data (e.g., 'NewsArticle', 'Product', 'SocialMediaPosting', 'VideoObject') which provides explicit classification signals. 3) Similarity Scoring: Comparing a new site's characteristics to a large learning set of websites with verified classifications to determine the best fit. 4) Authoritative Lists: Using curated seed lists from sources like Wikipedia (e.g., 'List of search engines') to provide high-confidence training data for specific categories.",
      "primary_category_selection_rule": "For websites that could fit into multiple categories, a single primary category is assigned based on the most dominant signals. The classification model weighs the evidence from content analysis, structured data, and other heuristics to determine the website's core purpose and user experience. For example, a news website that also has a shopping section would be classified as 'News & Media' if the vast majority of its content and user engagement is related to news, making that its primary function."

The most authoritative evidence is prioritized first: 1) Explicit Declarations in SEC Filings: A public company's direct statement in its 10-K or 20-F report about its principal revenue sources is considered ground truth. 2) Dominant Revenue Category in Financials: If not explicitly stated, the revenue breakdown in these filings provides quantitative proof (e.g., if subscription revenue is 70% of the total, 'Subscription' is primary). 3) Strong Technical/Platform Signals: In the absence of financial data, unambiguous signals like the presence of a comprehensive ads.txt file (Advertising) or a hard paywall (Subscription) take precedence. 4) Website Content and Functionality: The core user journey and primary calls-to-action on the site are analyzed as the final step.",
      "evidence_sources": "A wide range of observable signals and authoritative sources are used as evidence. These include: 1) Technical Signals: Presence of `ads.txt` or `app-ads.txt` files, and scripts from ad platforms like Google Publisher Tag or Prebid.js. 2) Platform Signals: App store labels such as 'Contains ads' or 'In-App Purchases' on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store. 3) Content Signals: The existence of 'Pricing' or 'Subscribe' pages, paywalls, shopping cart and checkout functionalities, 'Advertise with us' or 'Media Kit' pages, and affiliate disclosure statements mandated by the FTC. 4) Authoritative Sources: Annual financial reports (10-K, 20-F) from public companies.",
      "mixed_model_handling": "When multiple monetization methods are present, the primary model is determined by identifying the most significant contributor to revenue. For public companies, this is based on the quantitative data in their financial reports. For private companies where revenue data is unavailable, a qualitative assessment is made based on the prominence and integration of the monetization method into the core business proposition and user experience. For example, a content site with a few banner ads but extensive, deeply integrated affiliate product reviews would be classified as primarily 'Affiliate'."

In contrast, generic top-level domains (gTLDs) like '.com', '.org', or '.net' are not associated with a specific country and require explicit geotargeting signals (primarily hreflang annotations) to indicate their intended regional audience. Certain 'vanity' ccTLDs (e.g., .co, .io, .tv) are treated as gTLDs by search engines and also require explicit geotargeting.",
      "consolidation_rule": "If different regional sites (e.g., 'example.de' and 'example.com/de') present substantially the same content in the same language, they must be consolidated to avoid duplicate content issues. This is achieved by using the `rel='canonical'` tag to point to a single, preferred version of the page, in conjunction with `hreflang` annotations that signal the appropriate language and regional targeting for all other versions.",
      "distinct_entry_rule": "Regional domains, including ccTLDs and subdomains, are treated as separate and distinct entries in the ranking if they serve genuinely distinct content or are targeted at different audiences. For example, `bbc.co.uk` (for UK license fee payers) and `bbc.com` (for an international audience) are treated as separate entities. Similarly, Wikipedia's language-specific subdomains (e.g., `en.wikipedia.org`, `de.wikipedia.org`) are counted as distinct entries because they have unique, community-generated content and target different language communities."

This industry-standard framework provides common definitions for harmful content, establishing a 'Brand Safety Floor' for categories that should always be excluded (e.g., terrorism, child abuse material). It also defines three levels of 'Brand Suitability' (high, medium, low risk) for content that may be inappropriate for some advertisers but not all. This allows for a nuanced approach that balances neutrality with brand safety needs. The IAB Tech Lab Content Taxonomy (v3.0/3.1) should also be used as it provides a standardized language for describing content categories, including 'Adult & Explicit Sexual Content' and 'Crime & Harmful acts'.",
      "detection_methods": "A multi-modal approach is required for the technical detection of sensitive content. For extremist content, the primary method is leveraging the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT) Hash-Sharing Database (HSDB), which allows for the rapid identification of known terrorist and violent extremist content by sharing perceptual hashes. For adult/NSFW content, visual analysis using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify patterns like skin tone and anatomical shapes is the standard, enhanced by audio and text analysis. For piracy, detection involves identifying keywords, analyzing metadata, and tracking links to known illegal content sources. Perceptual hashing is a key technology across all categories to efficiently identify and deduplicate known harmful content.",
      "legal_compliance_focus": "The policy must ensure strict adherence to key European Union regulations. The Terrorist Content Online (TCO) Regulation (EU) 2021/784 is paramount, as it mandates the removal of identified terrorist content within one hour of receiving an official order. The Digital Services Act (DSA) provides a broader framework requiring platforms to act against all forms of illegal content and conduct proactive risk assessments. The Copyright in the Digital Single Market (DSM) Directive makes platforms liable for copyright-infringing content, which is critical for handling the 'Piracy' category. Finally, all data processing activities must comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), especially when dealing with user-generated content.",
      "escalation_protocol": "A clear and time-bound escalation protocol is essential. The TCO Regulation's one-hour takedown deadline for terrorist content necessitates a highly efficient internal process with a designated, always-accessible contact point for receiving removal orders. For crisis situations like livestreamed attacks, the GIFCT's Incident Response Framework (IRF) and Content Incident Protocol (CIP) should be followed to coordinate a rapid response. For all categories, a human-in-the-loop (HITL) system is a required safeguard. This involves human moderators reviewing borderline cases flagged by AI, handling user appeals, and feeding corrected classifications back into the model to improve its accuracy over time."

Their terms explicitly prohibit the sublicensing, reselling, publishing, distributing, or any other form of redistribution of their data to third parties without securing prior, explicit written consent. Using the data to develop a competing service is also universally forbidden. Caching data beyond a short period (e.g., one month for Semrush) often requires special permission. Violating these terms can result in immediate account termination and potential legal action for breach of contract and intellectual property infringement.",
      "attribution_requirements": "If a provider grants explicit consent for data redistribution, it is always accompanied by mandatory attribution requirements. These requirements are specific to each provider and must be followed precisely. For example, Similarweb requires the display of its name, logo, the phrase 'DigitalRank by Similarweb,' and a hyperlink to its website. Comscore specifies the exact wording: 'Comscore Marketsâ¢ information is used under License, and further use, reproduction and/or distribution.' Ahrefs and Semrush require attribution that complies with their brand usage guidelines, which would be provided upon granting permission. Failure to adhere to these attribution rules would be a violation of the redistribution agreement.",
      "gdpr_considerations": "The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applies to personal data. Truly aggregated and anonymized data, where it is impossible to single out, link, or infer information about an individual, is considered non-personal data and falls outside the scope of GDPR. However, the standard for true anonymization is very high. A significant risk is the potential for re-identification, where a dataset thought to be anonymous can be combined with other information to identify individuals, which would bring it back under GDPR's purview. It is critical to note that pseudonymization (e.g., hashing an IP address) is not the same as anonymization, and pseudonymized data remains personal data under GDPR. Therefore, before publishing any dataset, a thorough risk assessment, and potentially a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA), must be conducted to ensure the re-identification risk is negligible."

This includes deleting or renaming columns, or fundamentally altering the definition of a metric.\n- MINOR (e.g., 1.3.0): Incremented for backwards-compatible additions, such as adding new columns (e.g., a new enrichment metric) or expanding the scope (e.g., adding more websites to the list).\n- PATCH (e.g., 1.2.1): Incremented for backwards-compatible bug fixes, such as correcting errors found in a previous version's data through reprocessing.",
      "change_tracking_method": "With each new version of the dataset, an automated 'diff report' will be generated to provide clear and transparent tracking of all changes for stakeholders. This report will be a standard part of the monthly refresh output and will explicitly detail:\n1. Rank Changes: A list of all websites that have moved up or down in the rankings compared to the previous version.\n2. New Entrants / Exits: A list of any websites that have entered or dropped out of the top-2,000 ranking for each region.\n3. Schema Changes: A log of any modifications to the dataset's structure, which would correspond to a MAJOR or MINOR version change.",
      "api_change_monitoring": "A two-part strategy will be implemented to monitor and react to changes in provider APIs, which are often unannounced. \n1. Proactive Monitoring: The engineering team will be responsible for regularly reviewing the official API documentation and developer release notes from the selected data provider (e.g., Semrush).\n2. Reactive Alerting: The ETL pipeline will integrate a data quality tool like Great Expectations. This tool will perform automated schema validation on the data returned by the API during every run. It will act as a tripwire, automatically detecting any unexpected changes in the data structure (e.g., new, removed, or renamed fields) and triggering an immediate alert to the development team for investigation. This prevents breaking changes from corrupting the dataset."

    "project_execution_summary": {
      "estimated_cost": "The total estimated project cost is between $17,000 and $27,000. This budget is based on selecting Semrush as the primary data provider, which offers the most predictable and cost-effective model. The cost includes two main components: 1) Data Acquisition: This covers a Semrush subscription (e.g., Traffic & Market Pro at ~$250/month) plus the cost of API units. A bulk purchase of approximately 110,000 API units (to cover 4,000 domains across 27 EU countries) is estimated to cost several thousand dollars. Higher-cost alternatives like Similarweb (estimated $40,000-$50,000+) and Comscore (starting at $90,000) were deemed prohibitive for this project's scope. 2) Engineering Effort: This is estimated at 60-120 hours for a mid-level data engineer. At a rate of $100/hour, this amounts to approximately $12,000 to build, test, and deploy the ETL pipeline, including the complex EU aggregation logic.",
      "estimated_timeline": "A 6-week project timeline is proposed, with the following key milestones: \n- Week 1: Provider Selection & Procurement. Finalize the choice of data provider (recommended: Semrush), complete the procurement process, and secure API access. This week concludes with a Go/No-Go decision.\n- Weeks 2-3: Core ETL Pipeline Development. Build and test the data extraction, transformation, and loading scripts for a single country (e.g., US) to validate the process for all 4,000 domains.\n- Week 4: EU Aggregation & Scaling. Implement and test the complex logic for iterating through all 27 EU member states. Refine the pipeline to handle the large volume of API calls and data aggregation efficiently.\n- Week 5: Full-Scale Data Execution & Validation. Run the complete pipeline to source and aggregate MUV data for all domains across all target regions. Perform data quality checks and validation.\n- Week 6: Finalization & Handover. Prepare the final dataset, thoroughly document the pipeline architecture and its known limitations, and deliver the results to stakeholders.",
      "key_risks": "The project faces several significant risks: \n1. Invalid EU Aggregation (High Impact): The primary methodological risk is that summing unique visitor counts from different countries will result in a significant overestimation of the true EU-wide unique audience, as users visiting a site from multiple EU countries will be counted multiple times. The resulting 'EU MUV' metric is a 'gross audience estimate' at best and not a true deduplicated figure.\n2. Prohibitive Costs (High Impact): The need to pull data for each of the ~27 EU countries for every domain will multiply data costs by a factor of ~27. For Semrush, this escalates the requirement from 4,000 to ~108,000 API units per data pull, which could make the project financially unfeasible if not budgeted correctly.\n3. Incomplete EU Data Coverage (Medium Impact): Data providers may not offer reliable or available data for all 27 EU member states, particularly smaller markets like Malta or Cyprus. This would result in an incomplete and potentially skewed EU total.\n4. Metric Definition Discrepancies (Medium Impact): Each provider uses a different proprietary methodology (e.g., panel-based, device IDs, clickstream data) to estimate MUV, leading to different figures for the same domain. The choice of provider will introduce a specific, inherent bias into the final dataset.",
      "contingency_plan": "To mitigate the key risks, the following contingency plans are in place: \n1. To address Invalid EU Aggregation and Prohibitive Costs: The primary contingency is to pivot the project's scope. Instead of aggregating all 27 EU countries, the project will use a representative sample of the largest EU markets (e.g., Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Poland). The final report must then explicitly state this limitation and define the 'EU' as this representative basket of countries. This dramatically reduces API call volume and cost while still providing a strong directional signal for the EU market.\n2. To further mitigate Prohibitive Costs: A detailed, fixed quote will be secured from the chosen provider based on the full, revised scope (e.g., 4,000 domains x 5 representative countries) before any contract is signed or development begins.\n3. To mitigate Incomplete EU Data Coverage: Before signing a contract, a definitive list of all covered countries will be obtained from the provider. If key markets from the representative sample are missing, the project will either accept the data gap with documentation or explore a secondary provider to fill it, though this would increase engineering complexity."

      ],
      "reasoning": "The fine-grained field value depends on several tightly connected concepts that are explicitly described in the excerpts. First, the Monthly Unique Visitors concept is defined as the average number of unique visitors per month for a domain, which aligns with using a calendar-month aggregation as the fundamental unit and supports the notion of an annualized or year-window-based ranking metric. This establishes the core meaning of the primary metric (unique visitors per month, aggregated across the year). Second, the source describing \"Unique Visitors\" within the broader Website Traffic context reinforces that unique visitors are a count of distinct individuals over a given period, which underpins the idea that MUV is about reach, not just total visits. Third, the discussion of daily vs. monthly granularity clarifies how monthly unique visitors are derived and how different aggregations can impact the measurement, which is important for ensuring the year-long window uses consistent monthly figures. Fourth, an example from Semrush' Traffic Analytics documentation confirms that metrics like unique visitors are central to understanding audience reach, and that these metrics are commonly used in market ranking contexts. Taken together, these excerpts directly support the defined 1) primary metric (monthly unique visitors), 2) the time window (most recent full calendar year), 3) the ranking logic (descending order by the year-window average of MUV), and 4) the tie-breaking approach (useful context from engagement-related metrics when totals tie).",

Excerpts that define the Public Suffix List and explain how eTLD+1 is determined provide the core basis for domain canonicalization and consolidation in rankings. For example, entries explaining that a public suffix is a registrable suffix (e.g., com, co.uk) and that the registrable domain is the suffix plus one label establish the method for grouping subdomains under a single parent domain for ranking. Other excerpts elaborate that parked domains are a type of domain to exclude from rankings, which directly supports the exclusion criteria in the field value. Additional excerpts discuss ToASCII/IDNA processing and punycode as the standard for converting non-ASCII domain labels, which aligns with the IDN handling rule in the field value. Together, these excerpts substantiate the practice of deriving a single, canonical etld+1 per domain, excluding parked domains, and normalizing IDNs via punycode, as described in the fine-grained field. The ordering reflects direct definitions first (PSL/eTLD+1), then exclusion rationale (parked domains), then IDN handling (punycode/ToASCII). The included quotes underscore the exact concepts used in the field value, such as the PSL identifying registrable suffixes, the need to aggregate under the etld+1, the concept of a parked domain being excluded, and the IDNA/punycode transformation for IDNs.",

First, it distinguishes ccTLDs from gTLDs and notes that country-specific domains (ccTLDs) signal a country focus, whereas generic top-level domains (gTLDs) do not carry country signals unless accompanied by explicit localization indicators like hreflang annotations. This aligns with excerpts that define eTLD, eTLD+1, and their role in domain categorization, illustrating how country-targeting signals are derived and recognized in practice. Second, it highlights the need to consolidate regional sites with substantially similar content in the same language to avoid duplicate content issues, typically via canonical links and language-region signals (hreflang). The cited guidance emphasizes that canonical URLs, together with hreflang annotations, help search engines understand preferred regional versions and the intended audience, which is central to determining when regional variants should be consolidated versus treated as separate entries. Third, it notes that regional domains (ccTLDs and subdomains) should be treated as separate or distinct entries when their content or audience legitimately differ, providing concrete examples (e.g., a country-specific site for UK vs international audiences, or language-specific subdomains) to justify a regional split in ranking data. The included excerpts provide the definitions and distinctions for eTLDs and ccTLDs, explain the role of canonicalization and hreflang in multi-regional contexts, and give guidance on when to consolidate versus separate regional domains based on content and audience differences.",

Several excerpts directly define or describe this concept: One excerpt presents an Exhibit listing subsidiaries for Alphabet Inc., which demonstrates how a parent's ownership footprint is disclosed and identified in official filings. Another excerpt explicitly defines the term ultimate parent in a ways that aligns with IFRS 10 concepts and GLEIF terminology, describing the ultimate accounting consolidating parent as the top-level entity responsible for consolidated financial statements. Additional excerpts describe the LEI as a primary identifier used to connect entities to a single legal owner, and they reference the LEI data ecosystem (GLEIF) as a source for ownership relationships. There are also excerpts detailing the ROC/Level 2 data policy from GLEIF, which clarifies which entity is considered the ultimate owner in a layered corporate structure, and excerpts about GLEIF's LEI data formats (RR-CDF) that encode direct and ultimate ownership relationships. Further supporting evidence comes from SEC EDGAR exhibits listing subsidiaries and from UK Companies House data (PSC) used to infer ownership/control. Finally, there are excerpts describing LEI data APIs and how LEI records are used to determine ownership hierarchies, as well as examples where a specific company's ownership (e.g., Alphabet) is laid out in public filings, illustrating how ultimate parent attributions are determined in practice. Together, these excerpts establish: (1) a formal, multi-source approach to identifying the ultimate parent, (2) the specific data sources and identifiers used to anchor that attribution (LEI, EDGAR Exhibit 21, PSC/Companies House, OpenCorporates), and (3) concrete examples of how subsidiaries and parent relationships are disclosed in authoritative documents. The connection to the field value is therefore strong: the field value is a synthesis of the official definitions, data sources, and procedures to identify the ultimate parent, as evidenced by multiple authoritative references and concrete examples.

This endpoint supports retrieving top pages, which helps define a country-specific ranking useful for populating regional TOP lists. - The summary endpoint example shows retrieving target domains with fields such as visits and users, which maps directly to the required EstimatedMonthlyVisits or its equivalent as a monthly unique visitor proxy, enabling a bulk data pull for 2,000 domains per country with a compact, consistent schema. - A general description of the Traffic Analytics API methodology states that the API provides data on traffic rank, visits, and unique visitors, which is precisely the set of metrics desired for constructing the US and EU top-website datasets. - Comparative context notes that Semrush has a relatively favorable pricing/unit model, with API units consumed per request, which is advantageous for large-scale data pulls, and that Similarweb can be more costly or cumbersome to use for the same task. This supports the argument to use Semrush as the primary provider while acknowledging alternatives. - The cited examples show practical usage, including an explicit example call for summary data and an example with multiple targets, reinforcing the claim that Semrush can efficiently deliver the needed data for both regions, within a scalable API-based workflow. - The audience-facing API overview confirms that Semrush supports bulk requests (e.g., 200 domains per request in rank-related endpoints), reinforcing the feasibility of compiling 2,000 US + 2,000 EU domains with a small number of API calls per period, given the proper subscription and Trends add-on.",

The excerpts identified as most directly relevant discuss EU-focused measurement, aggregation, and limitations. In particular, a source that explicitly describes aggregating across EU member states, summing domain-level visitors, and using a non-deduplicated EU-wide total aligns with the requested field value. Additionally, items that describe the EU country-count (27 member states) and the lack of cross-country deduplication (which yields an upper-bound EU total) are highly supportive for understanding the caveats of such an aggregation. Documents discussing EU-wide data governance, privacy frameworks, or EU-specific measurement methodologies provide necessary context for interpreting an aggregated EU dataset and its limitations. Citations noting EU-wide travel/audience data in EU5 or EU-wide contexts help illustrate regional measurement practices, though they may be less directly tied to the precise EU-MUV summation method than the explicitly EU-wide aggregation items. Finally, references to cross-country deduplication challenges and the implications for upper-bound estimates reinforce the reasoning about why an EU-wide MUV figure could overstate deduplicated reach when summing country-level numbers.",

It also posits an EU top-website entry for Google (google.de) with Alphabet as the parent and around 0.5 billion monthly visits. Among the excerpts, a passage explicitly states that Google.com is the most visited US website with 21.26 billion monthly visits as of June 2025, which strongly corroborates the claim about Google's leading US position and very large traffic scale. The surrounding excerpts display top-US site rankings (including entries for google.com, youtube.com, amazon.com) and present monthly-visit figures in a tabular-like presentation, reinforcing that Google sits atop the US rankings and is associated with Alphabet as the parent company. The EU portion of the provided excerpts is less explicit about Google being top in the EU region, but there are European/top-traffic discussions and EU-focused Comscore/Mediametrie materials that contextually support the idea that major global sites (like Google) appear at the top of many EU-related traffic datasets, even though a precise EU-specific top-1 Google figure is not clearly stated in the excerpts. Overall, the strongest, directly corroborated support for the US field values comes from the explicit US ranking statement and the surrounding top-site entries, which align with the field value's assertion about Google's dominance and its association with Alphabet. The EU data in the excerpts is present but not as definitive for top-1 status, so it provides contextual support rather than a direct quote for Google's EU top ranking.",

Supporting evidence from the excerpts shows that: Monthly unique visitors are defined as the average number of individuals visiting the domain, and that this metric (unique visitors) is used to measure reach and to compare across time and domains. One excerpt explicitly states that Monthly Unique Visitors is the metric used to assess the actual reach of a website and to compare it against other measures (e.g., total visits, daily unique visitors), which aligns with using this metric as the basis for ranking. Another excerpt reinforces that users are defined as unique visitors, reinforcing the concept that the ranking relies on a count of distinct individuals per month. Additional excerpts discuss how the metric is used for strategy, investment, exposure, and benchmarking, which underpins why it is appropriate to sort domains by this metric for both the US and EU regions. Finally, a broader source notes a related, unduplicated audience metric, which corroborates the idea of measuring site reach by a unique visitor-based metric, supporting the methodological choice to rank by MUV. Taken together, these excerpts corroborate the methodology of ranking domains by descending average Estimated Unique Monthly Visitors over the full-year window, with the top domain at rank 1 and subsequent ranks following in order.",

Excerpts that discuss taxonomy-driven categorization, machine-readable category mappings, and programmatic taxonomy ecosystems are most directly supportive. Specifically, the excerpts that detail the Similarweb Categories API and related taxonomies outline a structured, programmatic taxonomy with named categories and mappings, which aligns with a model-driven labeling approach that relies on predefined categories and signals. Further, the excerpts showing how category names map to broader taxonomy groups illustrate how automated systems standardize classifications across sources. Collectively, these excerpts provide concrete evidence of a taxonomy-based, algorithmically powered labeling framework, including explicit category structures and mappings that would underpin an automated labeling engine. Excerpts describing the adoption and open availability of content taxonomies (e.g., updates and mappings) reinforce the existence and evolution of systematic labeling schemes that an automated approach could leverage. The most relevant material directly demonstrates the existence and use of machine-readable taxonomies and mappings that enable automated classification, while related excerpts offer context on taxonomy usage and updates that support the credibility and adaptability of such labeling systems.",

Several excerpts directly support this framing: they define what a \"unique visitor\" is and how it is measured, which is foundational to the field value. For example, a piece explains that unique visitors are the unduplicated visitors to a website over a period, which underpins the reliability of MUV as a ranking metric. Other excerpts describe how These traffic metrics are calculated by providers like Similarweb, including distinctions between total visits and unique visitors, and mention that different tools may yield different results due to methodology (e.g., cookies-based vs. non-cookie approaches). These directly support the need to rely on provider data and to acknowledge potential measurement differences across sources. The PSL-related excerpts outline the normalization step that the field value requires: canonicalizing domains to registrable roots using the Public Suffix List to enable consistent aggregation across the EU and US. This underpins the precise data cleanroom step in the plan, and is echoed in the cited PSL definitions. Other excerpts discuss EU aggregation caveats, noting that aggregating across 27 member states yields a gross audience estimate, and that the deduplicated EU-wide figure may not be obtainable from a single provider. This directly maps to the field's emphasis on an EU-wide dataset built from country-level figures and the caveat about deduplication. Additional excerpts enumerate the data provisioning constraints and policy considerations (e.g., data licensing and attribution requirements when redistributing provider data), which align with the field's emphasis on a compliant, repeatable data-collection methodology. Taken together, these excerpts substantiate the core elements of the executive_summary: the objective (top 2,000 US and EU sites by MUV, latest full year), the primary data sources (Semrush/Similarweb/Comscore), the canonicalization step (PSL-based), the exclusion rules for non-content domains, the EU aggregation caveats (gross vs. deduplicated), and the data-enrichment plan (parent company, HQ country, category, monetization) along with licensing/usage caveats. The strongest direct matches are the explicit definitions and discussions of unique visitors and how providers measure them, followed by PSL-based domain normalization and EU aggregation caveats. The remaining excerpts add context on measurement nuances and data-licensing constraints that support understanding the challenges and safeguards in the methodology. Overall, the field value is well-supported by multiple excerpts that address the key measurement construct (MUV), the data sources, normalization/aggregation techniques, and the EU-specific caveats.",

Another excerpt discusses web category analysis to understand the competitive landscape and a company's position, reinforcing the concept that the dominant category should capture the core positioning. Additional excerpts describe category mappings and taxonomies, which are mechanisms used to consistently translate a site's signals into a single primary category; these mappings provide the concrete framework for consistent labeling. Together, these excerpts substantiate the rule that the primary category is determined by the strongest, most representative signals from content and user behavior, and that established taxonomies guide the final labeling. A few excerpts specifically present Content Taxonomy material and its versions, which underpin the taxonomy framework and the criteria for assigning categories, further supporting the principle of selecting one primary category based on the main function and engagement signals. The excerpts collectively support the idea that a site's core purpose and dominant user engagement signals drive the primary category, rather than multiple lesser signals, and that standardized taxonomy mappings are used to implement this rule consistently.",

Supporting this, other excerpts reference the IAB Content Taxonomy (including versions 3.0 and 3.1) as a standardized language for describing content categories such as Adult and Explicit Sexual Content and Crime & Harmful acts, which is central to consistent content classification. Additional excerpts discuss EU regulatory measures that govern content moderation and data handling, notably the Terrorist Content Online (TCO) Regulation and the Digital Services Act (DSA). These passages articulate takedown timelines (e.g., one-hour takedown for terrorist content under TCO and broader platform obligations under the DSA) and cross-border handling of content in the EU, which are essential for formulating compliant moderation policies. References to GDPR-related concerns and anonymization/processing standards further support the field value's emphasis on compliance and data handling within a regulated landscape. Together, these excerpts provide a coherent frame: a safety floor for content that is universally excluded or heavily restricted, a taxonomy-based language for categorization, and EU-wide regulatory requirements that shape how content is managed, removed, or anonymized in practice. The remaining excerpts augment this by detailing taxonomy structure (Content Taxonomy 2.2/3.0/3.1 evolution) and supplementary governance artifacts (e.g., Brand Safety frameworks, data privacy standards) that reinforce a structured, policy-driven approach to sensitive content handling.",

One passage states that monthly unique visitors are the average number of individuals visiting the domain and highlights that the metric is foundational for other analyses, aligning with the notion of counting each individual once within the period. This directly supports the idea that the primary ranking metric is based on estimated unique monthly visitors. Another passage reiterates the concept of monthly unique visitors and emphasizes its utility in assessing reach and comparing it to other visit metrics, reinforcing that the metric is about a distinct user base per month rather than total visits. A third excerpt discusses the purpose of the metric as quantifying the unduplicated audience and notes combining unique visitors with visit frequency to understand audience size, which is aligned with measuring reach across users rather than raw traffic volume. A fourth excerpt reinforces the definition by explicitly describing monthly unique visitors as the average number of individuals visiting the domain and clarifies the deduplication context, which supports the interpretation of MUV as a unique-user measure across devices managed by the provider. A fifth excerpt adds context by focusing on the concept of unique visitors and provides a complementary perspective on how such metrics are used, which helps corroborate the overall framing of the primary metric even if it discusses related ideas rather than the exact definition. Collectively, these excerpts consistently describe monthly unique visitors as a distinct-user, calendar-month-based measure used to assess audience reach, with implications about deduplication and device-level aggregation that match the stated field value.",

Excerpts that discuss the taxonomy itself, its updates, and its mappings to other taxonomies or to the work of analytics providers provide additional backing for the idea that the final category list is a synthesis of this standard with category structures used by major analytics platforms like Google and Similarweb. Together, these pieces establish that the taxonomy standard is foundational and widely adopted, and that practical implementations involve integrating with other categorization frameworks used by analytics vendors. The inclusion of content about mappings between taxonomy systems further substantiates the claim of synthesis with provider category structures, aligning with the stated objective of a harmonized categorization scheme suitable for broad compatibility and brand-safety considerations.",

Additional excerpts describe that MUV can be used to assess a brand's reach and to compare monthly uniqueness to other visit types, which aligns with using a consistent, annualized average for ranking purposes. While these excerpts establish the general meaning and utility of MUV, they do not explicitly confirm the exact year-window definition (most recent full year) or the precise arithmetic averaging procedure over 12 months; however, they strongly support the fundamental components: MUV is the key metric, and it is an average/representation of monthly unique visitors over a period.

Excerpt content confirms the foundational role of Spearman's rank correlation for assessing how well rankings align across lists, and explains Spearman correlation in accessible terms. This directly supports using Spearman as a key validation statistic for rank-order alignment between sources. Additional excerpts discuss evaluating top site lists against a benchmark (Cloudflare baseline) to quantify agreement between lists, which is precisely the cross-provider validation scenario described in the plan. They describe methodology to compute similarity between lists (e.g., Jaccard index) and to analyze rank-order correlation, which matches the cross-provider analysis requirements in the plan. Moreover, cross-analytics discussions (Similarweb vs Google Analytics) document observed discrepancies and the existence of systematic differences between sources, which reinforces the need for a validation framework that includes cross-source comparison, plausibility checks, and QA procedures. The cited excerpts describing that cross-source comparisons reveal that Similarweb often reports lower totals or different rankings than Google Analytics (and that correlations between lists exist) directly illustrate the kinds of evidence and interpretation the plan aims to formalize. Finally, entries on reusing and critiquing cross-source lists (e.g., Ruth 2022) provide concrete precedent and metrics used in evaluating top site rankings against established baselines, which supports the plan's acceptance criteria requiring a minimum Jaccard score and a moderate-to-strong Spearman correlation, as well as monitoring for unexplained YoY changes. Overall, the most relevant parts are those that explicitly define and exemplify the cross-provider validation methods (Jaccard, Spearman), provide corroborating studies or analyses, and discuss observed cross-source discrepancies and statistical relationships, all of which underpin the plan's methodology and acceptance criteria.

      "reasoning": "- Excerpts listing Alphabet's subsidiaries and headquarters-related disclosures show real-world instances of identifying ultimate controlling entities and their country of incorporation or tax residence (e.g., Google LLC registered in Delaware; Alphabet Inc. as parent). These illustrate how corporate structure maps to an official HQ jurisdiction, aligning with the principle that HQ country is tied to the ultimate consolidating parent's jurisdiction. The subsidiary list demonstrates the practical manifestation of a holding company structure where the parent's home country governs consolidation and reporting, which is the logic behind designating the UPE's country as the official CompanyHQ_Country. \n- Additional Alphabet 10-K and related filings explicitly discuss domicile, country of incorporation, and the address of the registered office, reinforcing the rule that the HQ country is derived from the ultimate parent's jurisdiction and formal registration details in primary disclosure documents. This supports the idea that official country of incorporation or tax residence of the ultimate parent is used to determine the official HQ country.\n- LEI-related excerpts describe the HQ-related fields (HeadquartersAddress) and the role of LEIs in identifying the legal entity and its base location, which provides structured, machine-readable components to verify headquarters country across entities in corporate hierarchies. This supports a standardized, auditable approach to HQ country designation via authoritative identifiers.\n- The GLEIF LEI data and associated documentation (Level 1/Level 2 data formats) offer explicit mechanisms to retrieve headquarters country information as part of legal entity identifiers, enabling consistent HQ country determination across different jurisdictions and corporate structures. This aligns with the fine-grained field's emphasis on authoritative HQ-country data.\n- The IAS 1 disclosures excerpts emphasize the requirement to disclose domicile, country of incorporation, and headquarters address in financial statements, which provides corroborating guidance about what constitutes the headquarters location for reporting purposes and how it should be presented in official filings, thereby supporting the methodological rule that HQ country should reflect the ultimate parent's jurisdiction when determining consolidated reporting geography.\n- OECD BEPS Action 13 guidance and peer-review material articulate a defined concept of the Ultimate Parent Entity (UPE) and its role in country-by-country reporting, including criteria for when a parent is required to consolidate and report. This directly informs the disambiguation rule that the UPE's jurisdiction (i.e., its tax residence) should determine the CompanyHQ_Country in cases of multi-entity ownership, especially where there is a holding company structure in a different country from operational HQs.\n- Complementary excerpts discuss how to use authoritative sources to resolve conflicts (e.g., when a holding company sits in one country but operations are in another, the UPE/tax-residence rule serves as the tie-breaker). This supports a robust, defensible methodology for HQ-country assignment in multinational structures.\n- Other entries documenting country-by-country reporting frameworks, and the role of ultimate parent entities in consolidation, reinforce the same decision rule and provide broader ecosystem context for HQ country determination in multinational groups.\nOverall, the strongest support comes from explicit UPE definitions and OECD BEPS guidance, reinforced by primary disclosures (Alphabet/SEC filings) and official HQ-address source formats (GLEIF/LEI) and IAS 1 reporting requirements. The assembled evidence coherently supports using the ultimate parent's country of tax residence (as disclosed in consolidated financial statements and LEI data) as the official CompanyHQ_Country, with explicit procedural tie-breakers in cases of conflicting regional headquarters or multiple headquarters scenarios.",

Additionally, there is content explaining that IDNA2008 disallows certain symbols and punctuation that could be used for spoofing, which is relevant to the correct and secure handling of IDNs before they are processed or analyzed. Collectively, these sources support the claim that non-ASCII IDNs must be converted to an ASCII-compatible representation via ToASCII (ACE) strings for consistent DNS processing and analysis, with Punycode serving as the encoding mechanism and IDNA2008 providing the standard framework.",

The PSL's role in cookie inheritance boundaries and site grouping also reinforces its utility in consistent domain canonicalization across the dataset, ensuring that similar subdomains are not treated as separate entities due to differing subdomain levels. Additional context notes that the PSL is maintained and updated by volunteers and registries, underscoring its foundational role in domain normalization across browsers and analytics contexts.

The excerpts clearly support this structure: a reference to the GLEIF Level 2 data and the concept of determining ownership through a standardized LEI-based relation (emphasizing who owns whom) demonstrates the first-tier source. The discussion of Level 2 Relationship Records further clarifies how the StartNode (child) and EndNode (parent) relationships are defined in ownership chains, aligning with identifying ultimate parents. A policy excerpt describing the ROC policy confirms that only data that can be publicly recorded is captured, supporting why Level 2 data is suitable and publicly shareable. A SEC 10-K filing excerpt and an Exhibit 21 listing demonstrate concrete, authoritative filings used to corroborate subsidiary structures and parent-company attribution, fitting the second-tier source for corporate hierarchies. Additional excerpts referencing Alphabet's corporate structure and ownership exemplify how such sources are used to corroborate ownership disclosures. Lastly, while not all excerpts are directly named as stepwise components of the methodology, they collectively illustrate a multi-source validation approach (GLEIF LEI data, SEC filings, and public corporate records) that underpins linking a website to its ultimate parent, aligning with the described multi-source attribution framework.",

Excerpts describing the Trends API reference and the surrounding Semrush Traffic Analytics API documentation indicate that the API supports querying multiple targets (e.g., specifying targets and exporting columns), which aligns with bulk analysis of many domains.

Additionally, separate excerpts discuss rate limits and introductory API considerations, which are relevant to understanding the operational cost/usage constraints implied by the field value. However, none of the provided excerpts explicitly confirms the exact endpoint path stated in the field value (/analytics/ta/api/v3/rank) or provides the exact pricing figures, so those portions remain unverified.

      "reasoning": "The field value centers on concrete cost allocations, data-acquisition choices, and a six-week delivery timeline for a dataset project spanning US and EU domains. Excerpts that provide explicit pricing mechanics and unit costs directly support the cost components described in the field value, including Semrush pricing, API unit costs, and comparisons with other providers. For example, evidence that the Traffic Analytics API is priced per API unit (price: 1 API unit per request) directly substantiates the cost model used for budgeting data pulls. Additional excerpts note default monthly API usage limits and the existence of API-unit-based pricing across Semrush offerings, which reinforces the cost/volume considerations described in the field value. A separate excerpt comparing Semrush's and other providers' pricing, including free plan constraints and per-day limits, aligns with the decision context in the field value to choose Semrush as the primary data source due to cost predictability and scalability. These cost-focused excerpts collectively ground the cost components and procurement choices in the field value, making them highly relevant to the budgeting narrative. Other excerpts that describe API rate limits and usage caps (e.g., per-second limits) further support the feasibility and pacing aspects of the six-week timeline by clarifying what is technically possible within the proposed schedule. The six-week timeline itself is not directly evidenced in the excerpts, but the cost and API-limits context informs plausible milestones (provider selection, ETL development, EU aggregation, full-scale data pull, and validation), so these cost/governance details provide the strongest direct support for the field value's core budgeting and procurement assumptions. Excerpts touching on EU data governance concepts (Ultimate Parent Entity, CBCR) help explain why EU-wide aggregation introduces governance considerations, which underpin the contingency plan about EU aggregation coverage and potential sampling instead of full 27-country aggregation. While these governance excerpts do not validate the exact six-week schedule, they support the field_value's emphasis on cross-border data aggregation challenges and the need to acknowledge potential limitations in EU data coverage. Overall, the strongest alignment is with explicit API-cost and provider-cost information, followed by provider-comparison cost context, and then governance framing for EU aggregation. The remaining excerpts provide useful background on data governance concepts but have indirect relevance to the exact cost and timeline details in the field value.",

Excerpt content indicates that studies discuss audience measurements at the country level within the EU (the EU5 countries) and report counts for each country or region, rather than a single consolidated EU-wide deduplicated audience. This implies that the underlying data are structured as country- or region-level metrics (e.g., per-country audiences in EU5), which aligns with the stated caveat that summing these country-level MUVs would yield an upper-bound EU total rather than a deduplicated EU-wide figure. Additionally, references to regional or EU5-focused audience measurements (finance sites in Europe, EU5 region audiences) reinforce the notion that data are reported in regional or country-specific slices rather than a deduplicated EU-wide metric, thereby supporting the proposed limitation that cross-country deduplication is not inherent in the aggregation method described.",

Excerpt describing the Terms of Service of Ahrefs clearly states that the provider retains sole ownership of intellectual property rights, covering rights inherent to their services. This aligns with a fundamental term that the provider controls IP and sets licensing boundaries. Another Ahrefs excerpt emphasizes attribution requirements within those terms, illustrating how proprietary rights are acknowledged and licensed use is framed. This directly supports the notion of a restricted license and the need for adherence to specific usage constraints. Excerpt pointing to Comscore's Product Terms signals the existence of formalized licensing documents that govern product usage, which is central to a comprehensive terms review across providers. Finally, the excerpt mentioning public API and related disclaimers hints at permissible usage boundaries and how access rights are governed, which complements the licensing narrative, though it is less direct than explicit Terms of Service or Product Terms statements. Collectively, these excerpts substantiate the core claim that major providers enforce licensing terms that limit use, redistribution, and require compliance with prohibitions to avoid penalties, aligning with the field value's summary of internal-use licenses and prohibition of sublicensing or redistribution.",

Another excerpt mentions France in the context of site frequency and audience metrics, reinforcing that EU-wide analyses often feature country-level data points across various EU members. Additional excerpts address EU-wide governance and policy (regulatory text about the European Union), which helps frame the scope and compliance context for EU-wide data aggregation efforts. Finally, excerpts discussing localization practices and internationalized pages (e.g., localized versions in Google Search Central) support the idea that analyses consider multi-country EU contexts and cross-border data presentation, aligning with an EU-wide data aggregation framework. Specifically, the excerpts provide concrete country examples within the EU (Poland, France), confirm the relevance of EU-wide regulatory context, and illustrate EU-scale data handling approaches such as localization and regional comparisons, all of which support the concept that aggregation is meant to span multiple EU member states rather than a single market.",

A separate excerpt explicitly demonstrates a summary request including visits and users, further corroborating the presence of both metrics and their distinction. Together, these excerpts support the claim that MUV can be obtained via the API and that it is available across regions (the broader context mentions 190 countries, including the US and EU member states). Although other excerpts touch on general API basics and rate limits, they do not directly address the specific mechanism of retrieving MUV via the 'users' field, but they provide contextual support for the API ecosystem surrounding these metrics.",

Additional documentation from the GLEIF API emphasizes that the data support relationships such as parent and child, which underpins the practical identification of a top parent. Policy and data documentation related to Level 2 ownership data reinforce that only publicly recordable ownership relationships are captured, supporting the notion of a formally defined ultimate parent in datasets.

A statement explaining that SimilarWeb results can differ from other analytics services and that their measurements are not identical highlights the need to compare and quantify agreement across providers. Discussions that emphasize cross-provider analytics and potential discrepancies between services reinforce the rationale for validating rankings against multiple reputable sources. Additional work describing how top lists from various providers can be evaluated against each other further supports using overlap and correlation approaches to assess consistency across sources.

Additional excerpts from privacy-focused policies emphasize the role of data controllers and the security posture, which underpin GDPR compliance in practice. Collectively, these sources support the core points: GDPR applies to personal data; true anonymization is exceedingly stringent and often challenges the boundary between personal and non-personal data; pseudonymization does not remove personal data status; and before publishing datasets, a thorough risk assessment (potentially including a DPIA) is prudent to mitigate re-identification risk. The combination of GDPR-focused analytics guidance, EU regulatory context, and privacy policy disclosures provides corroboration for each of these claims, even though not every excerpt provides a detailed DPIA framework. The most critical connection is that GDPR applicability rests on whether data can identify individuals, and robust risk assessment (DPIA) is recommended when re-identification risk exists, aligning with the stated emphasis in the excerpts.",

            "Nov 28, 2018 â This Regulation establishes the same principle of free movement within the Union for non-personal data except when a restriction or aÂ ...See more In order to remove\n\t\t\tobstacles to trade and distortions of competition resulting from divergences between national laws and to prevent\n\t\t\tthe emergence of further likely obstacles to trade and significant distortions of competition, it is necessary to\n\t\t\tadopt uniform rules applicable in all Member States. (8)\tThe legal framework on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data, and on\n\t\t\trespect for private life and the protection of personal data in electronic communications and in particular\n\t\t\tRegulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council (1) and Directives (EU) 2016/680 (2)\n\t\t\tand 2002/58/EC (3) of the European Parliament and of the Council are not affected by this Regulation. (9)\tThe expanding Internet of Things, artificial intelligence and machine learning, represent major sources of\n\t\t\tnon-personal data, for example as a result of their deployment in automated industrial production\n\t\t\tprocesses. Specific examples of non-personal data include aggregate and anonymised datasets used for big data\n\t\t\tanalytics, data on precision farming that can help to monitor and optimise the use of pesticides and water, or\n\t\t\tdata on maintenance needs for industrial machines. If technological developments make it possible to turn\n\t\t\tanonymised data into personal data, such data are to be treated as personal data, and Regulation (EU) 2016/679\n\t\t\tis to apply accordingly.\n(10)   Under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, Member States may neither restrict nor prohibit the free movement of\n\t\t\tpersonal data within the Union for reasons connected with the protection of natural persons with regard to the\n\t\t\tprocessing of personal data. This Regulation establishes the same principle of free movement within the Union\n\t\t\tfor non-personal data except when a restriction or a prohibition is justified by public security reasons. Regulation\n\t\t\t(EU) 2016/679 and this Regulation provide a coherent set of rules that cater for free movement of different types\n\t\t\tof data. Furthermore, this Regulation does not impose an obligation to store the different types of data separately. (11)   In order to create a framework for the free flow of non-personal data in the Union and the foundation\n\t\t\tfor developing the data economy and enhancing the competitiveness of Union industry, it is necessary to lay\n\t\t\tdown a clear, comprehensive and predictable legal framework for the processing of data other than personal data\n\t\t\tin the internal market. A principle-based approach that provides for cooperation among Member States, as well\n\t\t\tas self-regulation, should ensure that the framework is flexible enough to take into account the evolving needs of\n\t\t\tusers, service providers and national authorities in the Union.\n ... \nSuch measures should ensure a level of\n\t\t\tsecurity appropriate to the risk presented, and should take into account the security of systems and facilities;\n\t\t\tincident handling; business continuity management; monitoring, auditing and testing; and compliance with interÂ­\n\t\t\tnational standards. These elements are to be further specified by the Commission in implementing acts under\n\t\t\tthat Directive. (37)   The Commission should submit a report on the implementation of this Regulation, in particular with a view to\n\t\t\tdetermining the need for modifications in the light of technological or market developments. That report should\n\t\t\tin particular evaluate this Regulation, especially its application to data sets composed of both personal and\n\t\t\tnon-personal data, as well as the implementation of the public security exception. Before this Regulation starts to\n\t\t\tapply, the Commission should also publish informative guidance on how to handle data sets composed of both\n\t\t\tpersonal and non-personal data, in order that companies, including SMEs, better understand the interaction\n\t\t\tbetween this Regulation and Regulation (EU) 2016/679, and to ensure that both Regulations are complied with.\n ... \nNo later than 29 November 2022, the Commission shall submit a report to the European Parliament, to the\n\t Council and to the European Economic and Social Committee evaluating the implementation of this Regulation, in\n\t particular in respect of:\n\t (a) the application of this Regulation, especially to data sets composed of both personal and non-personal data in\n\t\t the light of market developments and technological developments which might expand the possibilities for\n\t\t deanonymising data;\n\fL 303/68\t\t   EN\t\t\t\t\t\t  Official Journal of the European Union\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  28.11.2018\n\n\t (b) the implementation by Member States of Article 4(1), and in particular the public security exception; and\n\n\t (c) the development and effective implementation of the codes of conduct and the effective provision of information by\n\t\t service providers. 2. Member States shall provide the Commission with the necessary information for the preparation of the report\n\t referred to in paragraph 1. 3.

Excerpts showing explicit statements about advertising as a revenue stream or subscriptions as a revenue stream in major firms (for example, The New York Times reporting digital advertising revenue and subscription revenue, and Alphabet's revenue-related disclosures) provide ground-truth signals for monetization type. - Where filings explicitly break down revenue by category (e.g., Advertising vs. Subscriptions), those excerpts directly corroborate dominant monetization categories. - Technical signals relevant to monetization include the display of ads.txt and app-ads.txt, which are industry signals tied to advertising-based monetization and programmatic selling, aligning with Advertising as a primary monetization axis. - Content signals such as pricing/pages for subscriptions, or evidence of a paywall or pricing strategy, count as strong indicators of the primary monetization channel (e.g., Subscription). - General revenue and monetization context in disclosures (e.g., a site owner's reliance on advertising revenue or subscription revenue) provides supporting but weaker context if not explicitly tied to the specific site's monetization structure. - In cases where both Advertising and Subscription signals are present, the hierarchy prioritizes explicit declarations and the dominant revenue category from financials, with technical and content signals serving as corroborating evidence when financial detail is not explicit. - Overall, the excerpts collectively support a reasoning that assigns a primary monetization model by triangulating: explicit revenue declarations, then categorical revenue breakdowns, then technical/content indicators like ads infrastructure and pricing/subscription framing, and finally content-level monetization cues.",

Another excerpt similarly references google.com among the top US sites with a substantial traffic figure (19.899B), again directly relevant to the field's subject but not to the exact value provided (1.5B). A third excerpt mentions youtube.com as a top US site with its own traffic figure, which is still in the same crowd of leading sites and helps contextualize the US ranking environment, though it does not directly confirm the Google-specific metrics. The remaining excerpt discusses amazon.com, which is less relevant to the specific field value about Google and therefore contributes less to supporting the exact finegrained field value but helps illustrate the scope of the US top-traffic dataset.

The excerpt describing the GARM Brand Safety Floor and Suitability Framework explicitly names the framework, its purpose in establishing a safety floor for harmful categories, and the three levels of brand suitability, which aligns exactly with the requested policy guidance for handling sensitive content. The excerpts discussing the Content Taxonomy (IAB Tech Lab) demonstrate the need for a standardized language to describe content categories, including sensitive domains like Adult & Explicit Sexual Content and Crime & Harmful acts, which underpins how classifications should be applied across platforms. Together, these excerpts provide concrete evidence of both the governing framework (GARM) and the standardized taxonomy (IAB Tech Lab) invoked in the field value, including how categories and risk levels are defined and communicated. The remaining excerpts, which cover related safety and regulatory topics (e.g., broad brand safety solutions by IAB Tech Lab, and regulation texts addressing harmful or terrorist content online), provide supportive context about safety governance and compliance frameworks but do not name the exact safety framework or taxonomy specified in the field value; they help contextualize the broader landscape of content safety and regulatory alignment, reinforcing why standardized frameworks and taxonomies are critical for consistent application across regions. The overall interpretation is that the field value is about applying a recognized safety framework (GARM) with a standardized taxonomy (IAB Content Taxonomy) to categorize content for brand safety and suitability, and these excerpts collectively support that interpretation by naming and describing those elements and their purposes.",

Excerpts describing how correlations between analytics services (e.g., SimilarWeb, Google Analytics) compare and the typical range and behavior of these metrics offer contextual evidence that such correlations are a meaningful component of cross-source validation, which aligns with the field value's emphasis on correlation-based validation against a benchmark. These latter excerpts further support the idea that multiple cross-source comparisons are standard in evaluating the quality and reliability of top-site lists, reinforcing why Spearman correlation would be used as part of the acceptance criteria. While the field value mentions additional criteria (Jaccard Index, YoY traffic changes, and discrepancy reports), the provided excerpts do not contain explicit information about Jaccard indices, year-over-year change thresholds, or discrepancy logging, so those specific claims are not directly evidenced by the excerpts.

The most supportive excerpt notes that a summary API can return targets with visits and users, which directly aligns with obtaining MUV data. A closely related excerpt references an endpoint that lists top pages, implying access to domain-level popularity data via an API. Additional excerpts outline the general data methodology and examples of API usage, reinforcing that Semrush provides structured, country-specific rankings and metrics. While other excerpts discuss the existence of a Trends API and general introductions, they do not conflict with the main claim and provide supporting context about how Semrush APIs are used for traffic analytics. Taken together, these excerpts substantiate Semrush's suitability for the stated task due to accessible endpoints that return ranking and user/visit metrics in a consolidated fashion, which would streamline assembling the top-2,000 domain dataset per region.",

Excerpt describing subscription plans and the existence of costs for different plan levels directly informs the notion of a non-trivial ongoing cost and supports the idea that Semrush offers pricing tiers that would affect the total cost. Excerpts discussing the Semrush APIâits usage, limits, and how to construct requestsâprovide context for why API unit consumption is a cost driver and how higher usage could increase expenses. Excerpts that cover the process of accessing the Traffic Analytics API, including build-your-own-request details, reinforce that the data acquisition relies on API calls whose volume translates to cost. An excerpt referencing general API usage and the data methodology, while not focused on price, still anchors Semrush as a data provider and explains why its usage incurs unit-based costs. Together, these excerpts support the notion that Semrush is the primary cost-bearing provider, that there are subscription costs and API unit costs to consider, and that a calculated engineering effort is required to implement data acquisition and integration, matching the components described in the finegrained field value.",

The most direct support comes from excerpts that define the Ultimate Parent Entity (UPE) and describe its criteria within BEPS Action 13 and related BEPS peer-review documents, including explicit statements about the UPE ownership structure and the requirement to prepare consolidated financial statements, which underpins treating the ultimate consolidating entity as the holding company at the apex of the ownership chain. Additional excerpts discuss the concept of an ultimate parent in this context and the obligation to file consolidated statements, reinforcing that the UPE is the controlling entity at the group level. To connect HQ country determination to tax residence, related excerpts describe headquarters address and country in LEI data frameworks, which provide mechanisms for identifying the correct country context for corporate entities; these give methodological support for assigning the CompanyHQ_Country based on tax residence of the ultimate holding company, even if operations are geographically dispersed. In sum, the excerpts jointly establish (a) what constitutes the UPE and its consolidation role, (b) how the UPE is identified for reporting purposes, and (c) how HQ country information can be sourced and interpreted within LEI/beps-related data frameworks to determine the appropriate country of tax residence for the ultimate holding entity. The most directly supportive content is the explicit UPE definitions and consolidation criteria, followed by documentation corroborating how these definitions are used in reporting and data quality contexts (HQ country reference data).",

Excerpts that discuss how to access the Semrush API, what data is available (e.g., Traffic Analytics), and examples of API requests directly support the feasibility and sequencing of such a timeline. For instance, guidance on obtaining API access and understanding rate limits helps justify a weeks-long provisioning and ramp-up phase. Documentation detailing how to format API requests and what data columns are available informs the Core ETL Pipeline Development, including which metrics (like rank, visits, and other traffic signals) can be extracted and transformed. The data methodology discussions, while broader, underpin why a robust ETL process is needed to handle raw traffic data and perform validation across large domain sets. Together, these excerpts establish a practical basis for a six-week plan that leverages Semrush data through an API-driven pipeline, from provider selection through to final validation and handover, outlining concrete steps for data extraction, transformation, and quality control that align with the milestones described in the field value.",

      "reasoning": "- The ads.txt specification excerpts provide concrete cues about the presence and structure of ad inventory declarations on websites, including the core concept of \"ads.txt\" and extensions like app-ads.txt, which directly map to the first group of signals (Presence of ads-related files and domains). The mentions of specific fields such as OWNERDOMAIN and MANAGERDOMAIN illustrate how publishers declare ownership and monetization pathways, which aligns with the field's stated need for observable signals around ad inventory and monetization workflows. - Excerpts detailing the newer ads.txt v1.1 updates, including owner and manager domain fields, further reinforce how publishers indicate who sells their inventory, which is a central observable signal for monetization modeling. - Content describing the app-ads.txt extension (and its purpose to protect app inventory) directly supports app-level monetization signaling and aligns with the second group of signals around app store integrations. - Several excerpts discuss the Contains ads label in Google Play, which is a clear storefront signal of monetization practices on mobile apps, matching the content signals described in the field value. - FTC affiliate disclosure and related affiliate/disclosure policy excerpts illustrate authoritative disclosure requirements around monetization relationships (advertising/affiliate relationships), tying into the third signal group (affiliate disclosures and advertising transparency). - References to pricing pages, subscriptions, and advertising-based monetization concepts (e.g., \"A dvertising,\" \"Pricing,\" \"Subscribe,\" \"Media Kit,\" \"Advertise with us\") appear across discussions of monetization practices and content monetization signals, supporting the fourth signal group. - Finally, the field value lists corporate financial reports (10-K/20-F) as authoritative sources; corresponding excerpts touch on corporate reporting and advertising revenue discussions, which can corroborate monetization-related narratives at scale, though they are less direct signals about the specific observable indicators (ads.txt, app-ads.txt, Contains ads).",

The most directly relevant material specifies that the headquarters address and the country are captured in the GLEIF LEI data definition, with an emphasis on the Headquarters Address and country, and that ISO 3166 country codes are used to represent the location. This aligns with a methodology where corporate HQ country is anchored to official address data and standardized country codes. Additional corroboration comes from accounting and reporting standards that require disclosure of the country of incorporation and the principal place of business, as described in the IAS 1 framework, which anchors HQ country to domicile and registered office details. Supplementary sources include GLEIF API documentation, which describes access to LEI data including headquarters-related fields, and public reporting on corporate HQ moves that exemplify how HQ country can shift with corporate restructurings. Taken together, these excerpts support a methodology where HQ country determination relies on a prioritized set of sources: primary disclosures (annual reports/IR), standardized registry data (GLEIF HeadquartersAddress with ISO code), and corroborative regulatory disclosures, in line with the described source hierarchy.",

      "reasoning": "To support the fine-grained field value, I prioritize excerpts that provide explicit statements about a website's primary revenue source, which aligns with the most authoritative level in the hierarchy: explicit declarations in SEC filings and annual reports. The strongest evidence shows a company's revenue being generated primarily from advertising; for example, a public filing states that revenue is generated substantially from advertising placements, which clearly designates Advertising as the primary monetization channel. This is the most authoritative signal because it directly names the dominant revenue category in the company's official financial disclosures. Closely following, another excerpt confirms that at a later reporting date the company continues to report that revenue is driven by advertising, reinforcing Advertising as the ground-truth primary monetization. A separate filing notes advertising revenue in a quarterly/annual context (advertising placements), which again substantiates Advertising as the leading monetization model. These three pieces of evidence form the core of the hierarchy's first tier: explicit declarative statements in SEC/annual report materials indicating Advertising as the primary revenue stream. In addition, there is clear signal from infrastructure/disclosure documents and monetization overviews that Advertising is the dominant model in practice (for example, the ads.txt-related material discusses advertising inventory and its monetization implications, signaling Advertising as a core monetization channel, though not a direct revenue-share declaration). Finally, supplementary materials discussing general monetization concepts such as subscriptions and app monetization provide context for secondary signals, but do not override the higher-priority explicit declarations or the dominant Advertising revenue statements. Taken together, these excerpts support a hierarchy where explicit ground-truth declarations in SEC filings establish Advertising as primary, reinforced by consistent references to Advertising revenue in financial disclosures, with supplementary monetization information (e.g., subscriptions) available for edge cases but not contradicting the primary Advertising signal.",

In particular, statements that SimilarWeb results can differ from Google Analytics, the general tendency for cross-platform measurements to be conservative or to differ by a notable margin, and the reported correlation between analytics services all support the idea that any YoY analysis should account for measurement variability and seek corroboration across sources. These points directly inform a robust plausibility-check approach by framing expectations about measurement noise, suggesting a need to compare multiple data sources, and indicating that rankings and traffic volumes may shift within known margins rather than represent absolute ground truth. While other topics like statistical correlations are relevant to ranking stability, the core link is the emphasis on cross-source variability and cautious interpretation in plausibility checks.",
