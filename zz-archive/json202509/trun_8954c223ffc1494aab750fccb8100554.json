  "input": "Is Zig the new C langauge?  Is Rust the new C++?\n\nWhich languages will be the successor to C C++ to create coolest system programming open source jobs?",
  "output": {
    "executive_summary": "As of 2025, the systems programming landscape is clearly shifting, with Rust emerging as the de facto successor to C++ for new projects, and Zig establishing itself as a compelling successor to C. Rust's adoption is driven by its proven ability to eliminate entire classes of memory safety vulnerabilities—a critical issue that plagues C++—without sacrificing performance. This has led to its embrace by major technology companies like Google, AWS, and Microsoft for foundational infrastructure, from the Android OS to the Linux kernel. Consequently, Rust is in high demand for high-impact, security-critical open-source jobs. Zig's succession to C is rooted in its philosophy of being a 'better C' with modern features and, most importantly, its unparalleled, seamless interoperability with existing C codebases. This makes it ideal for modernizing legacy systems and for new projects that require C-level control, as demonstrated by its use in high-performance projects like the Bun.js runtime. For the 'coolest' open-source systems programming jobs by 2030, Rust and Go are the top contenders. Rust leads in domains requiring maximum safety and performance, while Go dominates the cloud-native space (e.g., Kubernetes, Prometheus) due to its simplicity and productivity. Zig is a high-potential niche, commanding top-tier salaries due to talent scarcity and its use in innovative projects.",
    "rust_as_cpp_successor_verdict": "Yes, Rust has firmly established itself as the viable and leading successor to C++ for new systems programming projects, particularly where security, concurrency, and reliability are paramount. Its core value proposition is delivering C++-level performance while guaranteeing memory safety at compile time, a feature that directly addresses the primary source of critical vulnerabilities in C++ codebases. This has been proven in production at a massive scale by companies like Google, which saw memory safety bugs in Android plummet after adopting Rust, and AWS, which built its core Firecracker virtualization technology in Rust. Further evidence includes its integration into the Linux kernel for safer driver development and its consistent ranking as the 'most admired' language by developers. While the vast existing C++ codebase ensures C++'s continued relevance for maintenance, Rust is the clear choice for new, secure, and high-performance systems, making it the definitive successor for modern development.",
    "zig_as_c_successor_verdict": "Yes, Zig is a highly compelling successor to C, not by aiming to replace it entirely, but by positioning itself as a 'better C' with first-class C interoperability as its standout feature. Its design philosophy modernizes C's core principles, offering improved safety, explicit error handling, and powerful metaprogramming (`comptime`) while retaining the simplicity and manual memory control that C developers value. Zig's ability to act as a drop-in C compiler (`zig cc`) and directly translate C code (`zig translate-c`) makes it uniquely suited for incrementally improving and migrating vast existing C codebases. Its adoption in demanding, high-performance projects like the Bun JavaScript runtime and the TigerBeetle financial database demonstrates its readiness for production. For projects that need C-level performance and control but desire modern tooling and a safer, more expressive language, Zig is the definitive successor.",

    "go_language_profile": "Go has carved out a dominant position in the systems programming landscape, particularly within the cloud-native and distributed systems domains. Its primary strengths are developer productivity and a simple, powerful concurrency model. Go is designed for fast compilation and features a gentle learning curve, allowing teams to achieve high velocity and enabling new developers to become productive quickly. This is exemplified by its status as the undisputed leader in the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), where it underpins foundational projects like Kubernetes and Prometheus. Its concurrency model, built around lightweight goroutines and channels, makes it exceptionally well-suited for building networked services and microservices. However, Go's primary performance trade-off stems from its garbage collector (GC). While the GC simplifies memory management for developers, it can introduce non-deterministic 'stop-the-world' pauses, which negatively affect tail latency. This makes Go less suitable for systems requiring consistent, extreme low-latency performance, such as core database engines or high-frequency trading platforms. Case studies, such as Discord's rewrite of a service from Go to Rust, have shown that these GC-induced latency spikes can be a critical issue at scale. Similarly, benchmarks comparing Go-based databases (like CockroachDB) to C++ counterparts (like ScyllaDB) reveal significant performance gaps in throughput and latency under heavy load. Therefore, Go's position is that of a highly productive language for general-purpose systems and networked applications, but it is often not the first choice for latency-sensitive, resource-constrained, or bare-metal systems where the performance characteristics of languages like Rust, C++, or Zig are preferred.",
    "performance_and_efficiency_comparison": "A detailed analysis of performance across Rust, C/C++, Go, and Zig reveals distinct trade-offs crucial for language selection in new systems projects. In raw performance, Rust, C, and C++ are top-tier as they compile to native code without significant runtime overhead. \n\n**Networking and Web Stacks:** In TechEmpower's Round 23 'Fortunes' benchmark, Rust frameworks dominated, with `may-minihttp` ranking first at 1,327,378 responses per second (rps). C/C++ were highly competitive, with the C-based `h2o` server second at 1,226,814 rps. Go frameworks like `fasthttp-prefork` were also very performant at 959,399 rps. A direct comparison showed a Rust-based proxy achieving approximately 4 times lower p99 latency than Nginx (written in C).\n\n**Databases and Storage Engines:** The absence of a garbage collector gives C++, Rust, and Zig a significant advantage in latency-sensitive database workloads. A YCSB benchmark comparing ScyllaDB (C++) and CockroachDB (Go) showed ScyllaDB achieving 9.3x higher throughput with one-fourth the p99 latency while managing 10x the data. Similarly, DragonflyDB (C++) demonstrated up to 30 times higher throughput than Redis (C) with stable memory usage. TiKV, a distributed database in Rust, achieves high performance, handling up to 200,000 operations per second with sub-10ms latency. For storage engines, RocksDB (C++) is considered a top choice for raw key-value storage.\n\n**Cryptographic Libraries:** Performance is often tied to hardware acceleration. Rust's `ring` library, which ports BoringSSL's optimized assembly, significantly outperforms pure-Rust libraries (~3.3 GiB/s vs. ~1 GiB/s for AES-256-GCM). C/C++ libraries like BoringSSL and OpenSSL show nearly identical peak performance, indicating a shared, highly optimized implementation.\n\n**Embedded Systems:** In resource-constrained environments, Rust and C/C++ exhibit similar runtime speed. Rust's compile-time safety comes without a runtime or GC. While Rust binaries can be larger initially, they can be stripped significantly. Zig is noted for producing smaller binaries than C. Rust's compile-time memory safety is a major advantage, eliminating entire classes of bugs that plague C/C++ in this domain.\n\n**Compile Times and Build Speed:** Go and Zig generally offer the fastest compilation. C/C++ can be slow for large projects, though C++20 modules are improving this. Rust has been known for slower compile times, but significant progress has been made, with a 6.37% improvement in mean wall-time from March 2024 to March 2025, and further reductions from using `lld` as the default linker.\n\n**Runtime Characteristics:** Go's garbage collector (GC) simplifies memory management but can introduce non-deterministic pauses, affecting tail latency. In contrast, Rust, C, C++, and Zig lack a GC, leading to more predictable and consistent runtime performance, a key advantage in low-latency systems. For concurrency, Go's goroutines are lightweight and efficient, though Rust's async model provides more control over execution and memory. The choice of memory allocator (e.g., `jemalloc`, `mimalloc`) can also significantly impact performance in C/C++/Rust.\n\n**Impact of Safety Checks:** Rust's primary value is providing memory safety without a runtime performance penalty. Its 'zero-cost abstractions' and ownership model eliminate categories of memory bugs at compile time, meaning safe Rust code can be as fast as equivalent, carefully written C++ code. Zig offers a pragmatic approach with different build modes (`Debug`, `ReleaseSafe`, `ReleaseFast`) that allow developers to enable or disable runtime safety checks, providing granular control over the performance-safety trade-off.",
    "security_outcomes_and_vulnerability_impact": {
      "vulnerability_statistics_in_legacy_languages": "There is overwhelming evidence from major technology companies and government agencies that memory safety errors in C and C++ are the predominant source of severe security vulnerabilities. Across the industry, it is estimated that 60-70% of all severe security vulnerabilities in large C/C++ codebases are due to memory safety issues. Microsoft has consistently reported that these issues account for a large portion of its Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), remaining at approximately 50% in recent years (2016-2023). The Google Chromium project attributes around 70% of its serious security bugs to memory safety problems. Furthermore, Google's Project Zero estimated that 67% of zero-days exploited in the wild in 2021 were memory-related, a figure that a 2025 NSA/CISA report raises to 75%. A CISA report from July 2024 highlighted that 52% of critical open-source projects are written in memory-unsafe languages, with the proportion of unsafe code increasing in larger projects.",
      "quantified_reduction_with_msl": "The migration to memory-safe languages (MSLs) like Rust has produced dramatic and measurable reductions in vulnerabilities. The most prominent case study is Google's adoption of Rust in the Android OS. Since prioritizing Rust for new native code development in 2019, the proportion of Android's total vulnerabilities caused by memory safety issues plummeted from 76% in 2019 to just 24% by 2024. The absolute number of such bugs is projected to drop from 223 in 2019 to 36 by the end of 2024. Critically, as of late 2022, with approximately 1.5 million lines of Rust code in Android, there have been zero memory safety vulnerabilities discovered in the Rust codebase. Google estimates this has prevented hundreds of vulnerabilities. Similarly, when Mozilla rewrote Firefox's CSS engine (Stylo) in Rust, an analysis showed that 73.9% of historical high-severity security bugs in that component would have been impossible to introduce under Rust's safety guarantees. While Zig is newer and has less data, its design aims to improve upon C's safety, though it does not provide the same compile-time guarantees as Rust.",
      "business_and_regulatory_impact": "Improved security outcomes from adopting MSLs translate directly into significant business value and align with a strong regulatory push. By preventing entire classes of bugs at the source, MSLs drastically reduce operational costs associated with incident response, emergency patching, and debugging, freeing up engineering resources for innovation. This leads to higher product quality, increased system uptime, and a better user experience. The business risk of costly data breaches and reputational damage is also reduced. This shift is strongly supported by government and regulatory bodies. The White House, NSA, and CISA have all issued strong guidance advocating for the adoption of MSLs. CISA's 'Secure by Design' program and its encouragement for companies to publish memory-safety roadmaps are key initiatives. The 2023 National Cybersecurity Strategy and a February 2024 White House report explicitly promote migration to MSLs. This regulatory pressure, combined with the clear business benefits, is creating a powerful incentive for organizations to move away from C/C++ for new development, which in turn drives hiring demand for developers skilled in languages like Rust."
    },
    "ecosystem_and_tooling_maturity_comparison": "The maturity of tooling and ecosystems varies significantly among Rust, Zig, Go, and C/C++, directly impacting developer experience and project viability.\n\n**Rust:** Features a highly mature, modern, and integrated ecosystem centered around `Cargo`, its all-in-one build system, package manager, test runner, and documentation generator. The central `crates.io` registry is vast and growing. Cross-compilation is well-supported via `rustup` and the `cross` crate. Debugging relies on standard tools like GDB and LLDB, enhanced with Rust-specific pretty-printing, though debugging `async` code can still be challenging. The testing ecosystem is robust, with built-in support for unit and integration tests, and mature community crates for property-based testing (`proptest`) and fuzzing (`cargo-fuzz`). Documentation is a major strength, with high-quality official resources like 'The Book'.\n\n**Zig:** A newer language whose primary tooling strength is its exceptional, built-in cross-compilation capability. The `zig cc` and `zig c++` commands can act as zero-dependency, drop-in replacements for GCC/Clang, simplifying complex C/C++ build workflows. It features an integrated build system (`zig build`) that replaces Makefiles or CMake. An official package manager, `zon`, is planned, but the community currently relies on tools like `zigmod`. The standard library is comprehensive but still evolving towards the 1.0 release. Testing is built-in with `zig test`, and debugging uses standard tools like GDB/LLDB.\n\n**Go:** Renowned for its simplicity and excellent built-in tooling. It uses Go Modules for dependency management. Cross-compilation is straightforward via `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables, though it becomes complicated when CGO is involved. It has a dedicated, powerful debugger, `Delve`, and excellent built-in profiling (`pprof`) and tracing tools. Native fuzzing support was added in Go 1.18. Its comprehensive standard library is a major strength, enabling rapid development.\n\n**C and C++:** As long-standing standards, they have the most extensive and mature, yet highly fragmented, ecosystem. There is no single standard build system or package manager; common choices include `CMake`, `Meson`, and `Bazel` for builds, and `vcpkg` or `Conan` for package management. This fragmentation requires more manual configuration and expertise. However, the variety of specialized tools is unparalleled, including advanced debuggers (`rr` for time-travel debugging), profilers (`Valgrind`, `perf`), and powerful sanitizers (AddressSanitizer, etc.) integrated into compilers. The testing ecosystem is also rich with frameworks like `GoogleTest` and `Catch2`.",
    "interoperability_and_migration_analysis": "A comparative analysis of Rust and Zig reveals distinct philosophies and capabilities regarding interoperability with and migration from C/C++ codebases. Rust's approach is centered on safety and providing robust tooling to bridge the gap, while Zig's is built on seamless, native integration.\n\n**Rust: Safety-First Interoperability**\n\nRust's interoperability is fundamentally based on the C Application Binary Interface (ABI). To call C functions, Rust code uses an `extern \"C\" {}` block, and to expose Rust functions to C, they are marked with `pub extern \"C\"` and `#[no_mangle]` to ensure a stable, C-compatible symbol. Memory layout compatibility is achieved by annotating structs with `#[repr(C)]`.\n\n*   **Tooling for C/C++:** The Rust ecosystem provides powerful tools to manage this interface:\n    *   `bindgen`: Automatically generates Rust FFI bindings from C and some C++ header files, significantly reducing the manual effort of declaring foreign types and functions.\n    *   `cbindgen`: Performs the reverse, generating C/C++ headers from Rust code, allowing C/C++ projects to consume Rust libraries.\n    *   `cxx`: A sophisticated crate for safe FFI between Rust and C++. It creates a hidden C ABI layer and allows for the definition of shared data structures, enabling direct calls between the two languages without manually writing `unsafe` FFI code. It supports native types like `std::string` and performs static analysis to prevent common FFI errors.\n    *   `autocxx`: Builds upon `cxx` to further automate the generation of safe Rust wrappers from C++ headers.\n\n*   **Build Integration:** The `cc` crate is the standard way to compile C/C++ code within a Rust project. It is typically used in a `build.rs` script, which is executed by Cargo during the build process, allowing for the seamless compilation and linking of C/C++ dependencies.\n\n*   **Migration Strategy:** Incremental adoption is a well-supported and common strategy. Tools like `cxx` and `autocxx` are specifically designed to facilitate the gradual rewriting of C++ applications, allowing teams to introduce Rust for new features or to replace security-sensitive modules within a large C++ codebase. While a transpiler named `C2Rust` exists, it produces functionally equivalent but largely `unsafe` Rust code that requires significant manual refactoring to become idiomatic and safe, making it a less common primary strategy.\n\n**Zig: Seamless C Integration**\n\nZig's interoperability with C is a core design feature, often described as a 'no-FFI' approach due to its seamlessness.\n\n*   **Tooling for C:**\n    *   `@cImport`: A built-in function that directly parses C header files (`.h`) and makes their types, variables, and functions natively available in Zig code.\n    *   `zig translate-c`: A powerful command-line tool that translates C source code directly into Zig code. This allows developers to convert entire C libraries into Zig and then refactor or improve them within the Zig ecosystem.\n    *   `zig cc` / `zig c++`: Zig ships with Clang and can act as a drop-in replacement for GCC or Clang. This is a major advantage for build integration, as it can be used in existing Makefiles or CMake projects to compile both C/C++ and Zig code. Its built-in, dependency-free cross-compilation is a standout feature.\n\n*   **Build Integration:** The `build.zig` system can natively compile C and C++ source files as part of a Zig project, simplifying mixed-language builds. The ability to use `zig cc` in existing C/C++ build systems makes integration exceptionally straightforward.\n\n*   **Migration Strategy:** Zig is ideally suited for incremental adoption in C projects. A team can start by using `zig cc` to take over the build process, then begin translating individual C files to Zig using `zig translate-c` or writing new components directly in Zig. The path is clear and technically well-supported, though there are fewer widely publicized case studies of large-scale C++ to Zig rewrites compared to Rust.\n\n**Comparative Summary:**\n\n*   **Ease of Use:** For C projects, Zig offers a more direct and seamless integration path. For C++ projects, Rust's `cxx` and `autocxx` provide a more mature and safer bridge for complex C++ features.\n*   **Safety:** Rust's primary value is creating a safe boundary around legacy `unsafe` code, preventing new memory safety bugs. Zig improves on C's safety with features like explicit error handling but does not provide Rust's compile-time memory safety guarantees, relying more on developer discipline.\n*   **Developer Productivity:** Rust has a steep learning curve but offers long-term productivity gains by catching bugs at compile time. Zig is easier for C/C++ developers to learn, but its manual memory management can be error-prone, and its pre-1.0 status means the ecosystem is still evolving.",

    "job_market_and_hiring_analysis": "The open-source systems programming job market is undergoing a significant shift, driven by the demand for memory-safe and high-performance languages. While C and C++ roles remain abundant, particularly for maintaining legacy systems, the most attractive and highest-paying new opportunities are increasingly in Rust, Go, and Zig.\n\n**Hiring Trends & In-Demand Skills:**\nThere is a strong and growing demand for Rust developers, fueled by its adoption in security-critical domains like cloud infrastructure (AWS, Cloudflare), operating systems (Android, Linux), and blockchain. The job market for Go is massive and stable, centered on the cloud-native ecosystem (Kubernetes, Prometheus), with roles like Software Engineer, SRE, and DevOps Engineer being highly sought after. The Zig job market is nascent but growing, with specialized roles in high-performance databases and runtimes. For all these modern languages, a background in C/C++ is often considered beneficial. For C/C++ roles, employers increasingly value expertise in modern standards (C++23, C23) and security tooling (sanitizers, static analysis).\n\n**Compensation Data (2024-2025):**\nCompensation directly reflects the supply and demand for skills. Newer, memory-safe languages command a premium:\n- **Zig:** Reported as the highest-paying language in the 2023 Stack Overflow survey ($103,611), with a 2024 median of $75,332.\n- **Rust:** Consistently a top earner, with a 2024 median salary of $76,292 and reported averages reaching up to $165,637 in some sectors.\n- **Go:** Also a high earner with a 2024 median of $76,433, reflecting its dominance in the lucrative cloud-native market.\n- **C/C++:** Have lower median salaries ($63,694 for C, $64,444 for C++) in the 2024 survey, likely reflecting a larger, more saturated market. However, specialized roles in domains like HFT and embedded systems still command very high pay.\n\n**Pathways from Open-Source Contributor to Paid Roles:**\nA clear pipeline from contribution to paid work has been established through several mechanisms:\n1.  **Foundation Support:** The **Rust Foundation** offers fellowships ($1,500/month stipend) and grants. The **Zig Software Foundation** directly pays contributors an hourly rate ($60/hour) for their work, funded by corporate and individual donations. The **D Language Foundation** offers bounties and hires for specific roles.\n2.  **Corporate Hiring:** Companies that rely on open-source projects are a primary source of employment. **AWS** and **Microsoft** hire Rust developers to work on the language and its ecosystem. **Bun** hires Zig engineers, and the vast number of companies using **Kubernetes** constantly hire Go developers.\n3.  **General Funding Initiatives:** Programs like the **Sovereign Tech Fellowship** (offering salaries of €63k-€78k), **Tidelift** (paying maintainers to improve security), and the **Linux Foundation** (employing kernel maintainers as Fellows) provide structured, paid opportunities for maintainers of critical projects across all languages.\n4.  **Mentorship Programs:** The **LFX Mentorship Program** and **OpenSSF Mentorship Program** offer stipends and serve as a pipeline for newcomers to gain skills and connections that can lead to paid roles.",
    "regulatory_and_compliance_factors": "Regulatory pressure and safety compliance standards are becoming powerful drivers for language choice in systems software, creating a significant tailwind for the adoption of Rust and a headwind for C and C++. A major catalyst is the strong, coordinated push from U.S. government agencies like CISA, the NSA, and the White House, which have issued multiple reports and guidance documents (e.g., 'Memory Safe Languages: Reducing Vulnerabilities in Modern Software Development', June 2025) advocating for a transition to Memory-Safe Languages (MSLs). These agencies explicitly recommend Rust and encourage technology producers to publish roadmaps for migrating away from C and C++ for new projects, citing data that 60-70% of severe vulnerabilities are due to memory safety errors. This government push is complemented by industry safety standards like ISO 26262 for automotive and DO-178C for avionics. While these standards are language-agnostic, they require rigorous validation and qualification of the entire toolchain, including the compiler. For C and C++, this necessitates using restrictive coding subsets like MISRA and expensive, proprietary qualified toolchains. The most significant development for Rust's adoption in these regulated environments is the recent availability of qualified compilers. Ferrous Systems' Ferrocene is the first open-source Rust toolchain to be qualified for the highest safety integrity levels (ISO 26262 ASIL D), with other vendors like HighTec and AdaCore also offering certified solutions. This removes a critical barrier, making Rust a viable, and often preferred, choice for new safety-critical systems. In contrast, emerging languages like Zig currently lack any certified toolchains, making them a 'non-starter' for these regulated domains.",
    "developer_learning_and_onboarding_comparison": "The comparison of learning curves, developer availability, and education pipelines for Rust, Zig, Go, C, and C++ reveals distinct profiles that significantly impact organizational hiring strategies and time-to-productivity.\n\n**Learning Curve and Onboarding:**\n\n*   **Rust:** Possesses the steepest initial learning curve among the modern languages. The primary hurdle is mastering the ownership and borrowing concepts enforced by the compiler's 'borrow checker'. New developers often report spending significant time 'battling the compiler'. However, this upfront investment yields long-term dividends. Once the concepts are understood (estimated at a few months), productivity often surpasses other languages because the compiler prevents entire classes of memory and concurrency bugs, drastically reducing time spent on debugging.\n\n*   **Go:** Is designed for simplicity and has a much gentler learning curve. Its straightforward syntax, garbage collector, and powerful built-in concurrency model (goroutines) allow developers to become productive very quickly. This makes onboarding new team members relatively easy.\n\n*   **Zig:** Aims for simplicity and a C-like mental model, making it relatively easy for experienced C/C++ developers to learn. Its explicit nature and lack of hidden control flow contribute to its readability. However, as a pre-1.0 language, the learning path is less defined by structured resources compared to Rust or Go, and developers must be comfortable with manual memory management.\n\n*   **C and C++:** Have a deceptive learning curve. Basic syntax is straightforward, but true mastery, especially of modern C++, is a long-term endeavor. The languages are fraught with pitfalls like manual memory management, undefined behavior, and complex template metaprogramming, which can severely hamper productivity and lead to subtle, costly bugs.\n\n**Developer Availability and Hiring Strategies:**\n\n*   **Talent Pool Size:** C and C++ have the largest existing talent pools by a wide margin. Go and Rust have smaller but rapidly growing and highly engaged communities. Zig's talent pool is the smallest, consisting mostly of early adopters and systems programming enthusiasts.\n\n*   **Developer Sentiment (Stack Overflow 2024-2025):** While usage is lower, developer desire for modern languages is extremely high. Rust has been the 'most admired' language for nine consecutive years (83% in 2024, 72% in 2025). Zig is also highly admired (73.8% in 2024, 64.2% in 2025). This indicates a large pool of developers eager to learn and work with these languages, which is a key advantage for hiring.\n\n*   **Salaries and Demand:** The high demand and smaller supply for modern systems language experts command premium salaries. 2024 Stack Overflow data shows median salaries for Go ($76,433), Rust ($76,292), and Zig ($75,332) are significantly higher than for C++ ($64,444) and C ($63,694). This signals a strong market demand for these newer skills.\n\n*   **Hiring Strategies:** For Rust, Go, and Zig, a primary strategy is to invest in training existing C/C++ engineers, leveraging their foundational knowledge and the high developer interest in upskilling. Simply hunting for the small pool of existing experts is often not scalable. For C/C++, the challenge is finding developers proficient in *modern* standards and practices.\n\n**Education and Training Pipelines:**\n\n*   **University Curricula:** C and C++ remain foundational in most computer science programs. However, top universities like Carnegie Mellon, Stanford, and MIT are increasingly integrating Rust into their curricula, offering dedicated courses and research programs, which is building a future talent pipeline.\n\n*   **Professional Training:** The ecosystem for Rust is particularly mature. Google offers its 'Comprehensive Rust' course for free, Microsoft provides introductory courses, and commercial vendors like Ferrous Systems offer intensive bootcamps. The Rust Foundation is also developing a formal certification program. Go also has a wealth of online courses. For Zig, resources are more community-driven (e.g., 'Ziglings'), with fewer formal, professional training options available yet.\n\n**Impact on Productivity and Cost:**\n\n*   **Time-to-Productivity:** Go offers the fastest time-to-productivity. Rust has a slower start but can lead to higher long-term velocity due to increased code reliability. Zig and C/C++ productivity is highly dependent on developer experience with manual memory management.\n*   **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO):** Rust's upfront learning investment is often justified by a lower TCO, resulting from reduced costs for debugging, security patching, and incident response. The high cost of memory safety vulnerabilities in C/C++ can lead to a significantly higher TCO over the project's lifetime.",

For projects where security is paramount (networking, OS components, crypto), **Rust** is the superior choice due to its compile-time memory safety guarantees, which eliminate entire classes of vulnerabilities and reduce long-term maintenance costs.\n\n2.  **Performance and Control:** For projects requiring absolute C-level performance and low-level control without the complexity of Rust's borrow checker, **Zig** is the leading contender. Its manual memory management and simple design make it ideal for performance-critical applications like runtimes and embedded systems.\n\n3.  **Developer Productivity and Time-to-Market:** For networked services, APIs, and cloud-native tooling where rapid development is key, **Go** remains an excellent choice. Its simple concurrency model, fast compilation, and comprehensive standard library offer high productivity, trading a small amount of raw performance for development speed.\n\n4.  **Interoperability and Legacy Migration:** When the primary goal is to augment or incrementally migrate an existing C codebase, **Zig** is the unparalleled choice due to its seamless C interoperability. For C++ codebases, **Rust** offers a robust migration path with tools like `cxx` and `autocxx`.\n\n5.  **Hiring and Talent Attraction:** C/C++ have the largest talent pools, but Rust has the highest developer admiration. Offering Rust projects can be a significant competitive advantage in attracting motivated, top-tier talent. While the Zig talent pool is small, its high compensation reflects a demand for specialized experts.\n\n**Decision Tree:**\n*   **New, secure, high-performance system?** -> **Rust**.\n*   **Modernizing a C project or need a 'better C'?** -> **Zig**.\n*   **Cloud-native application or microservice?** -> **Go**.\n*   **Maintaining a large, legacy C/C++ system?** -> Continue with **C/C++**, but adopt modern safety tooling and use Rust/Zig for new modules."

The following excerpts directly support these points: governance and decision-making in Rust are handled via RFCs, with a leadership-centric but distributed approach across sub-teams such as Language, Compiler, Library, and Dev Tools, ensuring no single entity dominates; leadership is provided by a Leadership Council that includes top-level representatives guiding overall direction; and the Rust Foundation provides organizational backing, trademark stewardship, and programs (grants/fellowships) that diversify funding and enable long-term stability for enterprise adoption. Specific passages describe: a) a structured governance apparatus with sub-teams and RFC processes guiding changes; b) an explicit Leadership Council that oversees the project; c) the Rust Foundation as an independent nonprofit that funds and sustains the ecosystem and manages infrastructure and trademarks; d) governance/oversight mechanisms that reduce risk by distributing authority and funding across multiple bodies rather than concentrating it in a single person or small group. Together, these excerpts map to the field value by showing how Rust's governance and funding architecture is designed to support stable, enterprise-scale adoption. They also indicate risk considerations such as reliance on a governance body rather than a single leader, and funding diversity via the Foundation's programs, which lowers organizational risk for enterprises investing in Rust. The strongest alignment comes from explicit descriptions of the governance structure (RFCs, Leadership Council, sub-teams) and the Foundation's role (funding, trademark, and governance support), with additional context from related governance notes and foundation materials reinforcing enterprise resilience and long-term stewardship. Specific relationships include: (1) RFCs and multi-teams for distributed governance, (2) Leadership Council for overarching governance, (3) Rust Foundation for organizational stability and funding, (4) grants/fellowships programs for broad contributor support, (5) formal governance documents outlining procedures and roles. The cited excerpts collectively provide comprehensive, corroborating evidence for the field value, with multiple sources reinforcing the governance and enterprise stability narrative.",

The text showing TechEmpower Round 23 web framework benchmarks highlights specific ranking and latency observations: a Rust-based framework (may-minihttp) leading with 1,327,378 requests per second, and C/C++ peers such as h2o delivering 1,226,814 rps, while Go-based entries (fasthttp-prefork) reach 959,399 rps. This establishes a clear, quantitative view of raw throughput and relative standing among languages commonly used in high-performance servers, which is central to the stated fine-grained field value about raw performance by language. Moreover, it notes a concrete performance delta for a Rust-based proxy that achieves roughly four times lower p99 latency than Nginx (C-based), illustrating Rust's potential advantages on tail latency in proxy workloads. These points directly support the claim that, in raw performance and tail latency, Rust and C-family languages can exhibit different advantages depending on workload and framework choices, informing language selection for future system projects. The accompanying excerpts also discuss C/C++ and Rust in the context of databases and storage engines (e.g., ScyllaDB in C++, TiKV in Rust, Redis in C). The absence of a garbage collector in Rust, C, and C++ is repeatedly tied to latency advantages in storage and latency-sensitive workloads, which further supports the core comparison of performance characteristics across languages. Finally, the excerpts address Zig and Zig's performance considerations in the ecosystem, noting its place as a lower-overhead alternative in some scenarios, and contrasting compile-time vs runtime safety trade-offs, which contextualizes Zig's performance profile alongside Rust and C/C++. Taken together, these excerpts provide a cohesive, benchmark-driven picture of performance across Rust, C/C++, Go, and Zig, including throughput, tail latency, and memory-management implications relevant to system programming workloads.",

For example, Zig is described as a zero-dependency, drop-in C/C++ compiler that supports cross-compilation out-of-the-box, which directly underpins the idea of Zig replacing or seamlessly augmenting C workflows in production contexts. The documentation around C translation and interop (zig translate-c, @cImport) reinforces Zig's capability to translate or call into existing C code with minimal friction, which is essential to migrating large C codebases incrementally rather than rewriting from scratch. Several excerpts discuss Zig's C interop primitives (C primitives like c_char, c_int, and the @cImport machinery) and demonstrate practical interoperation with C headers, which is a key enabler for Zig serving as a successor to C in practical terms. Additional excerpts present real-world adoption signals, such as Zig being used in high-performance systems contexts (e.g., Bun runtime, TigerBeetle) and discussions of Zig's tooling that supports replacing or building atop C ecosystems, which bolster the claim by showing production relevance. Collectively, these excerpts connect Zig's design goals (memory-safe, explicit control, comptime features) and tooling (zig cc, zig translate-c, cImport) with concrete deployment scenarios and interoperability that position Zig as a compelling successor pathway to C.\n",

Direct comparisons and claims in the excerpts map cleanly to this narrative. For example, a piece explicitly contrasts Zig as a \"hands-off\" language and discusses deriving from C with a modern memory-safe stance, which supports Zig's role as a successor to C. Other excerpts directly describe Rust as replacing or challenging C++ in safety-critical or performance-sensitive contexts (notably memory-safety advantages that reduce CVEs, and high adoption by major tech players). Additional excerpts discuss the ecosystem-level implications (Rust's Linux kernel involvement, cloud/Google/AWS adoption, and Rust Foundation activities) that reinforce the claim that Rust is now a dominant, safety-first choice for modern system programming, while Zig serves as a compelling alternative with excellent C interop. The combination of these excerpts provides strong, multi-angle support for the claim that Rust is the de facto successor to C++ for new system projects and that Zig is a strong successor to C, with memory-safety benefits driving industry adoption and high-salary, high-impact jobs in OSS. The included roadmap/expert commentary further corroborates that the Rust/Zig dynamic is shaping the future of open-source systems programming tooling and workforce demand. The reasoning relies on placing the most direct, comparably framed statements first (Rust replacing C++ and Zig replacing C), followed by perpendicular lines of evidence about memory safety, industry adoption, and ecosystem momentum.",

Quotations from these excerpts illustrate Go's formal governance structures, the process by which proposals are introduced, discussed, and either accepted or declined, and how leadership roles (e.g., the 'shepherd' or core decision-makers) guide the evolution of the language and its ecosystem. In particular, excerpts detailing the Go proposals process, Go governance machinery, and the relationship of Go with its community and CNCF context provide direct support for claims about Go's dominant, structured, and governance-driven presence in the cloud-native and systems programming space. Additional excerpts that discuss Go's role within CNCF and its ecosystem governance further reinforce the claim that Go sustains a leadership role in cloud-native tooling and orchestration projects. The combined evidence from these excerpts shows a coherent picture: Go occupies a central, governance-driven position in CNCF ecosystems, with clear processes for proposals and governance that shape its trajectory and adoption in large-scale systems. The strongest links come from the sequence of excerpts that outline explicit Go governance and proposal procedures, followed by those that frame Go's ecosystem context within broader organizational structures and forums.",

For example, Rust-for-Linux and kernel documentation illustrate concrete adoption of Rust in kernel and driver development, signaling a move beyond C++ toward safer system components. Production case studies (e.g., Google Android's shift toward memory-safe languages, AWS Firecracker written in Rust) provide concrete, scale-validated evidence that Rust can replace or complement C++ in critical infrastructure. Public sentiment data showing Rust as the most admired language further reinforces the narrative that Rust is not only functionally capable but also trusted and valued by the developer community for systems-level work. Additional signals come from compiler and tooling context, where Rust's safety model and strong memory guarantees are repeatedly contrasted with C/C++ vulnerabilities, and from performance discussions indicating Rust often achieves C-like performance with fewer memory-safety risks. While C++ remains highly relevant for legacy and massive codebases, the cited production usage, safety outcomes, and reputational signals collectively support the view that Rust is the leading modern successor in the space of memory-safe, high-performance systems programming. The excerpts describing Linux kernel adoption, Android memory-safety initiatives, and Firecracker's Rust implementation provide direct evidence of real-world deployment and security benefits; the excerpts about Rust's admiration and community sentiment provide supporting context for its growing status as the de facto successor in new projects; the compiler performance and safety discussions reinforce that Rust can meet the performance bar while improving safety. Taken together, these excerpts substantiate the field value asserting Rust as the leading successor to C++ for new systems programming work, particularly where security and reliability are paramount.",

This directly supports the claim that Zig's tooling maturity is evolving rapidly and is increasingly self-contained, reducing reliance on external toolchains. Content about Zig's cImport/translate-c mechanisms illustrates Zig's approach to C interop tooling, highlighting the maturity and direction of Zig's interop tooling. The notes about an official package manager (zon planned) and reliance on existing tooling (zigmod) further contextualize Zig's ecosystem maturity trajectory. Beyond Zig, Rust's tooling ecosystem is well documented in the excerpts: Cargo as an all-in-one tool, crates.io as a central registry, rustup for cross-compilation, and a robust testing/documentation ecosystem (The Book, proptest, cargo-fuzz). These points underscore a highly mature, integrated tooling story for Rust, which serves as a strong contrast to Zig's more nascent but rapidly maturing tooling. The Rust-vs-Zig portions provide comparative context on maturity and developer experience across these ecosystems, reinforcing the overall claim that toolchain maturity varies by language, with Rust being more mature and Zig still catching up in areas like package management and ecosystem breadth. The Go and C/C++ sides are touched less directly in these excerpts, but the breadth of Rust's and Zig's tooling discussions suffices to support the field's claim that maturity is heterogeneous across ecosystems and materially affects developer experience and project viability.",

            "der to satisfy the requirements of Cloudflare's position in the HTTP ecosystem, we needed a robust, permissive, customizable HTTP library that can survive the wilds of the Internet and support a variety of noncompliant use cases. The best way to guarantee that is to implement our own. The next design decision was around our workload scheduling system. We chose multithreading over [multiprocessing](https://www.nginx.com/blog/inside-nginx-how-we-designed-for-performance-scale/) in order to share resources, especially connection pools, easily. We also decided that [work stealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_stealing) was required to avoid some classes of performance problems mentioned above. The Tokio async runtime turned out to be [a great fit](https://tokio.rs/blog/2019-10-scheduler) for our needs. Finally, we wanted our project to be intuitive and developer friendly. What we build is not the final product, and should be extensible as a platform as more features are built on top of it. We decided to implement a “life of a request” event based programmable interface [similar to NGINX/OpenResty](https://openresty-reference.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Directives/) . For example, the “request filter” phase allows developers to run code to modify or reject the request when a request header is received. With this design, we can separate our business logic and generic proxy logic cleanly.",

In production contexts, Firecracker (AWS) is implemented in Rust, and Cloudflare's Pingora is a Rust-based proxy framework used in production networks. These concrete milestones illustrate a shift in OS/hypervisor contexts toward Rust for new components and safety-critical subsystems, while C remains dominant for legacy kernel code due to scale and inertia. Memory-safety narratives across Android, Google/NSA/CISA guidance, and industry reports reinforce Rust's safety advantage in OS-level software. Put together, these excerpts support a forecast in which by 2030 Rust becomes the standard language for new OS/drivers/subsystems, with C continuing for legacy kernel code, Zig filling specialty roles (bootloaders, niche modules), and a sustained emphasis on memory-safe language adoption across the ecosystem. The forecast text formalizes that trajectory and cites the listed real-world anchors to ground the projection in observed milestones and corporate backing.",

      "reasoning": "The fine-grained field asserts several key points about vulnerability impact and the business/regulatory push toward memory safety. The strongest support comes from explicit percentage-based claims anchored to major players:Microsoft reports that memory-safety issues account for roughly 70% of security bugs, which directly corroborates the claim that memory-safety problems dominate large-C/C++ codebases. Additionally, a separate security-bulletin family (CSIS/NSA/NSA-derived guidance) highlights that memory-safety-related vulnerabilities are pervasive across industries and that government-backed guidance advocates adopting memory-safe languages to mitigate these issues. In particular, government and industry sources document that memory-safety issues are responsible for large shares of CVEs and zero-days, and that shifts to memory-safe languages yield measurable reductions in vulnerability counts in real-world deployments, such as Android and Firefox. The cited NSA/CISA materials emphasize memory-safety roadmaps and strategic adoption, underscoring the regulatory/business motivation to move away from memory-unsafe languages for new development. The memory-safety literature also includes a synthesis piece on the practical impact of Memory Safe Languages (MSLs), illustrating broad reductions in vulnerabilities when moving codebases to Rust, and citing Android and Firefox case studies as prominent exemplars. The combination of vendor-cut data (Microsoft), industry/government analyses (Google/Chromium, NSA/CISA), and synthesis/summary articles provides converging evidence that memory-safety vulnerabilities are a dominant issue and that adopting memory-safe languages yields substantial risk reductions. The content is cohesive and aligned, with government-reported percentages and enterprise/vendor data reinforcing the field's stated values. The citations collectively support the core claim that vulnerability impact in legacy languages is dominated by memory-safety issues and that migration to memory-safe languages yields dramatic reductions, with multiple independent sources corroborating the trend.",

The excerpt noting that Rust is the most admired language in the 2025 Stack Overflow survey directly substantiates its popularity and employer demand, reinforcing Rust's top-status in future job markets. Evidence of Rust's practical, large-scale deployments—such as Rust being used in the Linux kernel and Android platform memory-safety improvements—strengthens the argument that Rust is not just theoretically favored, but actively shaping core systems and open-source ecosystems, which translates into robust job opportunities and funding. The Rust Foundation's role and funding programs provide a concrete mechanism for career pathways (fellowships, grants, events) and thus bolster paid open-source work for contributors, which is central to the stated research question about \"open source jobs\" linked to Rust. Real-world production use cases of Rust-based proxies and runtimes (like Pingora) illustrate practical demand for Rust expertise in high-performance networked systems, aligning with the described job market trajectory. The kernel-level adoption of Rust (Rust for Linux) and the ongoing development ecosystem (with OpenSSF Alpha-Omega funding and Rust Foundation initiatives) offer both market signals and tangible avenues for employment and collaboration. Finally, Go's dominance in cloud-native ecosystems (e.g., Kubernetes, Prometheus) provides a counterpoint with substantial job availability, reinforcing the ranking position for Go as the second most attractive language for future system/programming roles. The combination of survey data, production deployments, and ecosystem funding paints a coherent picture of Rust at the top of the future job landscape, with Go and other contenders supporting a multi-hypothesis view of the ecosystem. Together, these excerpts collectively justify a ranking where Rust is first, followed by Go, and with additional evidence for other systems-oriented languages and ecosystems that influence future opportunities in paid open-source work.",

Direct references show that: government agencies repeatedly advocate memory-safe languages (Rust in particular) to reduce memory-safety vulnerabilities, and they urge publishers of roadmaps and adoption plans; safety standards and tool qualification processes create compliance considerations that can tilt decisions toward Rust in safety-critical domains. Several excerpts explicitly describe: the 70% figure for memory-safety-related vulnerabilities as context for preferring memory-safe languages; official guidance from CISA, NSA, and White House ONCD promoting memory-safe languages and roadmaps; and the availability of ISO 26262, DO-178C and certified toolchains (Ferrocene, HighTec, AdaCore) enabling Rust adoption in safety-critical environments. Together these excerpts lay out a coherent regulatory and standards-driven rationale for why Rust is favored and why C/C++ adoption faces barriers in regulated contexts. ",

Excerpts detailing Zig's C interop surface (direct, built-in C integration, translation tooling, and build-system integration) provide strong support for Zig's seamless C interop philosophy and practical migration path. The cited Zig items show that Zig offers @cImport and translate-c for direct C interop, plus native Zig build-system integration and Clang-backed cross-compilation, which aligns with the claim of seamless native integration and tooling support. Conversely, excerpts describing Rust interoperability show Rust's established FFI ecosystem: bindgen to auto-generate Rust bindings from C headers, cbindgen to generate C headers from Rust, and the cxx/autocxx family to create safer interop boundaries and to bridge C++ with Rust. The cited Rust-related excerpts demonstrate a mature, safety-forward approach to interoperability, emphasizing generated bindings, safe wrappers, and tools that minimize unsafe FFI boilerplate. The blend of Rust tooling and Zig interop tooling provides concrete, side-by-side evidence for the stated field value, illustrating the two languages' distinct interoperability philosophies: Rust focusing on safety via FFI boundaries and tooling (bindgen, cbindgen, cxx, autocxx), and Zig focusing on seamless, built-in C interoperability (C imports, translate-c, and Zig's build/system integration). Some excerpts also touch incremental migration strategies (e.g., migrating C/C++ gradually using safe wrappers or tooling), which supports the migration aspect of the field. Overall, the excerpts collectively substantiate the comparative analysis of Rust's safety-first interoperability versus Zig's seamless C interop, including practical tooling and incremental migration approaches. The strongest, most direct support comes from explicit descriptions of Zig's C interop capabilities and Rust's FFI tooling, while additional excerpts provide context on migration strategies and interoperability tooling beyond the core comparison.",

The most directly relevant excerpt identifies what developers must understand to be productive in Rust, explicitly highlighting the borrow checker as a core hurdle and noting that once mastered, productivity can exceed that of other languages due to stronger guarantees against memory and concurrency bugs. This directly substantiates the claim about a steep initial learning curve for Rust and its eventual payoff in productivity. Other excerpts discuss onboarding and training resources for Rust more broadly, including university curricula and formal training programs, which illustrate how education pipelines shape the availability of Rust-skilled developers and the time-to-productivity for teams. Additional excerpts touch on Go, Zig, C, and C++ learning curves at a high level, providing contextual contrast to Rust's onboarding landscape, and some sources summarize Rust education pathways (courses, university courses, Rust Foundation initiatives) that influence hiring strategies and the speed with which new hires reach productive output. Taken together, these excerpts support the field value's core claims about learning curves, onboarding difficulty, and the education/training pipelines that shape organizational hiring strategies and time-to-productivity for Rust, Zig, Go, C, and C++.

If you need to pass [cflags]() to clang, or if you would like to edit the translated code, it is recommended to use `zig translate-c` and save the results to a file. Common reasons for editing\n the generated code include: changing `anytype` parameters in function-like macros to more\n specific types; changing `[*c]T` pointers to `[*]T` or `*T` pointers for improved type safety; and [enabling or disabling runtime safety]() within specific functions.

Subsequent runs with\n the same source file, target, and cflags will use the cache instead of repeatedly translating\n the same code.\n ... \nFunctions that contain opaque types or code constructs that cannot be translated will be demoted\n to `extern` declarations. Thus, non-translatable types can still be used as pointers, and non-translatable functions\n can be called so long as the linker is aware of the compiled function. `@compileError` is used when top-level definitions (global variables,\n function prototypes, macros) cannot be translated or demoted. Since Zig uses lazy analysis for\n top-level declarations, untranslatable entities will not cause a compile error in your code unless\n you actually use them. See also:\n\n* [opaque]()\n* [extern]()\n* [@compileError]()\n\n### [C Macros]() [§]()\n\nC Translation makes a best-effort attempt to translate function-like macros into equivalent\n Zig functions. Since C macros operate at the level of lexical tokens, not all C macros\n can be translated to Zig. Macros that cannot be translated will be demoted to `@compileError` .

Additional excerpts emphasize Zig's explicit memory-management stance (no GC/runtime, developer-controlled lifetimes), which maps to the Safety and Usability portion of the field value. Several excerpts highlight key language features and tooling that enable strong interop with C and system-level integration: comptime for compile-time code execution, translate-c for translating C to Zig, and the @cImport primitive for direct interop with C headers. These pieces connect to the claimed advantages in interoperability and cross-language workflows in the field value. The build system and cross-compilation discussion illustrate Zig's ecosystem enablement for modern, cross-target system projects, which supports the Adoption and Ecosystem facet of the field value. Real-world signals like Bun and TigerBeetle references provide concrete examples where Zig's design and tooling are being leveraged in high-performance contexts, reinforcing adoption and applicability claims. The progression from Zig's design principles to tooling and real-world usage forms a coherent chain that substantiates the fine-grained field value's multi-part assertion about Zig's language design, performance-centric goals, safety considerations, and ecosystem momentum. The excerpts collectively substantiate the central claim that Zig aims to be a simpler, explicit, safer C-like alternative with strong interop, compile-time capabilities, and a growing ecosystem, including notable deployments in high-performance systems. In short, the strongest support comes from explicit statements about Zig's design goals and safety-oriented memory model, followed by evidence of tooling (comptime, translate-c, @cImport) and examples of ecosystem adoption (Bun, TigerBeetle).",

      "reasoning": "- The language design portion is supported by statements describing Rust as a language focused on memory safety and safe concurrency, with ownership concepts that prevent common memory-safety bugs, which directly reflects the stated language design in the field value. For example, sources explicitly framing Rust as a safe systems language with ownership/borrowing semantics illustrate how memory safety is embedded in the language design and how it reduces use-after-free and data races at compile time. This aligns with the claim that Rust emphasizes memory safety and concurrency without sacrificing performance through its ownership model. \n- Adoption and case studies are evidenced by references to Rust's integration into major, safety-critical infrastructures, including Linux kernel work and adoption in large-scale platforms (e.g., cloud providers and Android). These excerpts illustrate real-world deployment of Rust in production-grade systems, demonstrating the adoption component of the field value. \n- Tooling and ecosystem coverage is supported by discussions around Rust's tooling ecosystem and governance, including references to the Rust Foundation's grants and community programs that bolster tooling, ecosystem growth, and contributor support, which underpins the field's tooling and ecosystem claim. \n- Community and safety impact is underscored by notes on Rust's growing community, safety guarantees, and industry adoption momentum, reflecting how the community and safety aspects reinforce Rust's leadership in safe systems programming. The cited excerpts collectively map to the four components of the fine-grained field value and corroborate the overall narrative of Rust as a memory-safe, production-proven, well-supported systems language with a strong ecosystem.",

Excerpts describing Mojo Overview and Mojo Roadmap directly address its differentiators, corporate backing, and roadmap, which align with Mojo's prominence in the outlook. The Carbon language is presented as an experimental successor to C++, with goals of seamless bidirectional interoperability with C++, a modernized syntax, and a long-term roadmap; these points connect to the field's focus on future major contenders and interoperability advantages. Excerpts on D and Nim provide context for other potential emergent languages with distinct memory-management and interoperability traits, contributing to the broader competition and job-market implications discussed in the field. Additional references to Embedded Swift (Swift-for-systems) and notes on interoperability with C/C++ reinforce the notion that multiple languages are competing for system-level niches and cross-language interoperability, which feeds into the overall outlook of multiple viable successors and adjacent ecosystems. Specific quotes that anchor these connections include Mojo's description as a Python superset with performance parity to C++/Rust and memory-safety guarantees, and its corporate backing by Modular; Carbon's description as a bidirectional-interoperable successor to C++, with a Google-led origin and an open-source, governance-oriented approach; and D and Nim as mature/niche players with their own tradeoffs and potential market niches.

Java was rejected since it would involve deploying JVM on their servers. 🙃🙃\n\n> The challenges that npm faces demand efficient and scalable solutions. When a service can be deploy-and-forget, that saves valuable operations time and lets them focus on other issues. npm employees also value having a helpful community around any technology they use.

The strongest evidence centers on Cloudflare Pingora, where Pingora (a Rust-based proxy) handles trillions of requests daily and achieves dramatic efficiency gains (CPU and memory reductions, TTFB improvements, massive reduction in new-origin connections, and zero crashes due to memory safety). This directly supports a production_adoption_case_studies entry for Cloudflare Pingora with language adopted being Rust and domain being networking, plus explicit outcomes and lessons. Additional highly relevant entries describe Google's Android OS migration to Rust, which reports a substantial drop in memory-safety-related vulnerabilities from 76% to 24% (and zero Rust memory-safety vulnerabilities discovered in Android to date), illustrating a large-scale, real-world safety improvement. Discord's Read States service is another strong match, showing a Go-to-Rust rewrite that eliminated GC-induced latency spikes and outperformed a carefully tuned Go baseline, with clear latency, CPU, and memory benefits. AWS Firecracker is a canonical production Rust case: a Rust-based microVM that consumes very little memory per instance, with ultra-fast startup and high-density deployment, underscoring Rust's suitability for virtualization in production. TigerBeetle's database shows a Zig-based client achieving extremely high throughput and a memory-safety-focused design, plus a detailed discussion of safety guarantees and testing practices. Dropbox's Nucleus Sync Engine rewritten in Rust demonstrates deterministic behavior and improved correctness, with compiler-checked invariants improving reliability. Additionally, other excerpts describe broader implications and lessons learned from these migrations (e.g., safety benefits enabling faster feature work, measurable reductions in vulnerability counts, and the general strategic reasoning behind adopting memory-safe languages in large-scale systems).

            "der to satisfy the requirements of Cloudflare's position in the HTTP ecosystem, we needed a robust, permissive, customizable HTTP library that can survive the wilds of the Internet and support a variety of noncompliant use cases. The best way to guarantee that is to implement our own. The next design decision was around our workload scheduling system. We chose multithreading over [multiprocessing](https://www.nginx.com/blog/inside-nginx-how-we-designed-for-performance-scale/) in order to share resources, especially connection pools, easily. We also decided that [work stealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_stealing) was required to avoid some classes of performance problems mentioned above. The Tokio async runtime turned out to be [a great fit](https://tokio.rs/blog/2019-10-scheduler) for our needs. Finally, we wanted our project to be intuitive and developer friendly. What we build is not the final product, and should be extensible as a platform as more features are built on top of it. We decided to implement a “life of a request” event based programmable interface [similar to NGINX/OpenResty](https://openresty-reference.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Directives/) . For example, the “request filter” phase allows developers to run code to modify or reject the request when a request header is received. With this design, we can separate our business logic and generic proxy logic cleanly.",

Additional excerpts note that by 2025 Linux is no longer purely a C kernel and emphasizes safety, performance, and maintainability brought by Rust in core areas like drivers, which reinforces Rust's role for new components and drivers. Other excerpts discuss specific Rust deployments in system contexts (such as microVMs and proxy infrastructure) that demonstrate Rust adoption beyond user space, again supporting Rust as the language for new components. Some excerpts explicitly discuss ongoing C use in kernel maintenance by describing a transition or hybrid ecosystem where Rust augments but does not wholly replace C for core kernel work. This supports the pattern that C continues to be used for core kernel maintenance while Rust handles newer components and drivers. References about Zig are not present in the provided excerpts, so there is no evidence within these excerpts to attribute any kernel support or niche use cases to Zig; this absence suggests Zig is not currently evidenced as a major part of the forecast within these sources.

It also foresees Zig occupying niche roles like bootloaders. The excerpts provide several direct statements about Rust's trajectory in kernel-related contexts: the Linux kernel has expanded Rust support in 2025, with Rust code entering driver paths and driving safety improvements; it is described as no longer solely a C kernel but a hybrid where Rust contributes to safety and maintainability in kernel-related work; discussions of Linux kernel 6.13 highlight stronger Rust driver support, indicating Rust's encroachment into areas previously dominated by C. Additionally, excerpts describe Rust-based ecosystems and tooling (e.g., Firecracker and Cloudflare Pingora) that demonstrate Rust's suitability for performance-critical, system-level code, reinforcing the trend toward Rust as a major language for systems work outside traditional core kernel paths. These points directly support the portion of the field value claiming Rust will be the de facto language for new non-core kernel components and that C will remain for core maintenance. While some excerpts also illustrate Rust adoption in adjacent system areas (e.g., microVMs and proxies), they do not contradict the forecast and help illustrate broader momentum for Rust in low-level software. The explicit Zig-based bootloader niche forecast is not supported by the provided excerpts, so that portion remains unsupported by the evidence here.",

The most directly supportive evidence mentions Android having Rust components and security improvements as a result, describing that adopting memory-safe languages correlates with security gains in Android. Additional sources discuss broader industry backing for memory-safe languages (such as NSA/government statements advocating memory-safe languages) and high-level statements about reductions in memory-safety vulnerabilities when languages like Kotlin and Rust are used, which reinforces the overall trend described in the field value. Some excerpts provide concrete numbers or explicit trend lines (e.g., the drop in memory-safety vulnerabilities in Android over time or the proportion of vulnerabilities caused by memory safety issues), while others describe the cause-and-effect relationship or provide corroborating observations without exact figures. Taken together, these excerpts support the core claim that migrating to memory-safe languages, with Rust as a leading example, has led to substantial reductions in memory-safety vulnerabilities, particularly evidenced by Android's historical data and related industry analysis. The strongest support comes from the explicit reference to Android's Rust adoption and the associated security improvements; stronger numerical precision is present in the surrounding context but not fully replicated in every excerpt.\n",

      "reasoning": "The field value argues that Odin & V will have minimal impact on the future system-programming job market because they lack strong corporate backing, foundational support, and clear hiring signals, and thus compete in a crowded space dominated by Zig and Go. The provided excerpts collectively illustrate several key points that help contextualize this assessment: Zig is growing in popularity and is highlighted in a major technology survey as one of the admired languages, indicating clear community interest and momentum; Rust has significant adoption in kernel development and enterprise, showing strong institutional support and hiring signals for Rust-related roles; Rust-based projects and organizations (Rust for Linux, Pingora, the Rust Foundation) demonstrate a well-supported ecosystem that compounds the job-market signal for established languages. In short, these excerpts show that languages with strong corporate backing, active ecosystems, and broad adoption (like Rust, Zig, and Go) tend to shape hiring and job-market signals in system programming. In contrast, the fine-grained field value posits Odin & V lack such backing, which would logically limit their impact relative to Zig and Go in the job market by 2030. The reasoning in the field value mirrors this comparative ecosystem dynamic: without a breakout project or major corporate adoption, Odin & V are unlikely to create broad, attractive job opportunities, especially when competing against more established or better-funded options. Therefore, the excerpts support a contextual link: the current ecosystem dynamics favor languages with robust ecosystems and institutional support, which is consistent with predicting limited job-market influence for Odin & V based on the stated justification. The claim about Zig and Go functioning as stronger competitors in the \"better C\" or \"simple compiled language\" space aligns with the presented evidence of Zig's popularity and the enterprise/Rust adoption landscape; this strengthens the argument that Odin & V would struggle to outperform these established players in the job market without significant breakthroughs or widespread corporate backing. Overall, while Odin & V are not directly evaluated in the excerpts, the information about language momentum, ecosystem support, and hiring signals supports the inference that Odin & V would have limited impact relative to Zig and Go unless there is a major shift in backing or a standout open-source project.",

There are a few ways that Zig facilitates C interop. ### [C Type Primitives]() [§]()\n\nThese have guaranteed C ABI compatibility and can be used like any other type. * `c_char`\n* `c_short`\n* `c_ushort`\n* `c_int`\n* `c_uint`\n* `c_long`\n* `c_ulong`\n* `c_longlong`\n* `c_ulonglong`\n* `c_longdouble`\n\nTo interop with the C `void` type, use `anyopaque` . See also:\n\n* [Primitive Types]()\n\n### [Import from C Header File]() [§]()\n\nThe `@cImport` builtin function can be used\n to directly import symbols from `.h` files:\n\ncImport\\_builtin.zig\n```\nconst c = @cImport ({\n    // See https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/515\n    @cDefine ( \"_NO_CRT_STDIO_INLINE\" , \"1\" );\n    @cInclude ( \"stdio.h\" );\n});\npub fn main () void {\n    _ = c.printf( \"hello\\n\" );\n}\n```\nShell\n```\n$ zig build-exe cImport_builtin.zig -lc\n$ ./cImport_builtin\nhello\n```\n\nThe `@cImport` function takes an expression as a parameter.\n ... \nIn practice, `@cImport` is useful as a way to quickly and easily access numeric constants, typedefs,\n and record types without needing any extra setup. If you need to pass [cflags]() to clang, or if you would like to edit the translated code, it is recommended to use `zig translate-c` and save the results to a file. Common reasons for editing\n the generated code include: changing `anytype` parameters in function-like macros to more\n specific types; changing `[*c]T` pointers to `[*]T` or `*T` pointers for improved type safety; and [enabling or disabling runtime safety]() within specific functions. See also:\n\n* [Targets]()\n* [C Type Primitives]()\n* [Pointers]()\n* [C Pointers]()\n* [Import from C Header File]()\n* [@cInclude]()\n* [@cImport]()\n* [@setRuntimeSafety]()\n\n### [C Translation Caching]() [§]()\n\nThe C translation feature (whether used via `zig translate-c` or `@cImport` ) integrates with the Zig caching system. Subsequent runs with\n the same source file, target, and cflags will use the cache instead of repeatedly translating\n the same code.\n ... \nFunctions that contain opaque types or code constructs that cannot be translated will be demoted\n to `extern` declarations. Thus, non-translatable types can still be used as pointers, and non-translatable functions\n can be called so long as the linker is aware of the compiled function. `@compileError` is used when top-level definitions (global variables,\n function prototypes, macros) cannot be translated or demoted. Since Zig uses lazy analysis for\n top-level declarations, untranslatable entities will not cause a compile error in your code unless\n you actually use them. See also:\n\n* [opaque]()\n* [extern]()\n* [@compileError]()\n\n### [C Macros]() [§]()\n\nC Translation makes a best-effort attempt to translate function-like macros into equivalent\n Zig functions. Since C macros operate at the level of lexical tokens, not all C macros\n can be translated to Zig. Macros that cannot be translated will be demoted to `@compileError` . Note that C code which _uses_ macros will be\n translated without any additional issues (since Zig operates on the pre-processed source\n with macros expanded).

Another excerpt reinforces the broader industry pattern by noting that memory-safety vulnerabilities have been a dominant class of bugs, aligning with the field's assertion about their prevalence. Additional excerpts describe notable security improvements and reduced vulnerability counts in memory-safe languages (as seen in Android and other platforms), which, while not always giving exact percentages, corroborate the trend that adopting memory-safe languages reduces exposure to memory-safety related vulnerabilities. A further item discusses the general importance of memory-safe languages, supporting the idea that organizations are prioritizing safer language ecosystems to mitigate such vulnerabilities. Collectively, these pieces connect to the field value by providing explicit percentages for a major platform (Microsoft CVEs) and by illustrating broader industry trends and policy/adoption signals toward memory safety as a vulnerability-mitigation strategy. The strongest, most direct evidence is the percentage claim about Microsoft CVEs; the following items extend support through industry-wide patterns or outcomes observed after adopting memory-safe approaches. The content also mentions a separate NSA/CISA context and ongoing movement toward memory-safe languages, which adds credibility to the claim about prevalence and concern around memory-safety vulnerabilities in legacy languages. \n",

Supporting details show Zig's cross-compilation and build-system advantages, which are essential enablers for adoption in modern projects, including zero-dependency, cross-platform builds and a cohesive workflow. Additional excerpts discuss Zig's interoperability with C and tooling like @cImport and the Zig translation features, which reinforce Zig's practical integration within existing ecosystems and systems programming contexts. While some excerpts address general Zig documentation rather than adoption per se, they provide necessary context about capabilities (cross-compilation, build system, C interop) that underpin adoption in high-performance domains and open-source projects. Taken together, the excerpts collectively support the idea that Zig is gaining traction in modern ecosystems through performance, cross-platform tooling, and coherent build/interop capabilities.",

None of the excerpts explicitly confirm this Google/Android case. However, multiple excerpts describe real-world, production-level Rust adoption in other large-scale or OS-like contexts, including: a Dropbox case study showing Rust used to rewrite core sync infrastructure, with language emphasis and safety benefits; industry analyses of Microsoft adopting Rust to augment large C/C++ codebases for memory safety; discussions of npm adopting Rust for performance-critical components; and narrative overviews of Rust adoption in high-performance or system-facing projects like Firecracker, Linkerd, and various industrial deployments. These provide concrete evidence that Rust is being adopted in production-grade, system-oriented environments and that such adoption yields benefits like memory safety, performance, and reduced vulnerabilities. While these support the general premise that Rust can be adopted in OS-like domains, they do not substantiate the exact Google/Android-specific field value (company: Google, project: Android OS, outcomes). Therefore, the strongest connections are to the general pattern of production Rust adoption in OS/system contexts and the reported measurable benefits (e.g., memory-safety improvements, performance gains, and reduced vulnerabilities) demonstrated in the cited cases. Specifically, the following aspects are relevant: language adoption in a major system software context (Dropbox Nucleus, Windows/Microsoft Rust integration), production-grade deployments with safety/performance outcomes, and explicit statements about Rust enabling safer, more efficient system components. These points align with the field value's themes even though they do not confirm the exact Google/Android instance. In sum, the most relevant excerpts are those that document concrete, production Rust adoption in large-scale or OS-like projects and report tangible benefits; supporting excerpts show Rust used for safety and performance in real-world systems, which is conceptually aligned with the field value, but they do not provide direct evidence for Google's Android OS case.",

The excerpts about the Rust Foundation provide concrete evidence of organized support, infrastructure, and investment behind Rust, which directly counters the claim that languages like these lack corporate backing and thus would have minimal hiring signals by 2030. Together, these show a spectrum: Zig is a popular competitor, while Rust has visible corporate-backed infrastructure and governance, suggesting that at least some of the \"top languages\" have significant backing and potential job signals, which challenges the assertion that the target languages will have minimal impact. Other excerpts about Rust integration into the kernel and Rust for Linux further illustrate real-world adoption and ecosystem maturity, reinforcing the idea that backing and adoption can create meaningful job markets, again countering the notion of minimal impact. The Pingora and Cloudflare excerpt demonstrates Rust ecosystem activity in practical infrastructure, adding to the picture of a well-supported language space rather than the under-supported scenario described in the field value. Taken together, these excerpts mostly imply more backing and momentum than the field value suggests, with Zig as a notable contender and Rust-backed institutions as a strong counterexample to the claim of negligible job-market impact.",

This supports the idea that adoption could occur through gradual migration, which is relevant to estimating market impact, even if it does not guarantee high influence by 2030.

Other excerpts extend the discussion to license hosting and governance (which influence ecosystem development and adoption) but do not directly touch the 2030 market impact timing.

This indicates that TigerBeetle is discussed in the realm of performance benchmarks, which is the closest alignment to the stated quantifiable outcome. However, the excerpt does not provide the exact Zig-based client, the 1.56 million transfers per second figure, or the no-allocation-after-startup claim, nor does it tie these specifics to a production_adoption_case_studies entry at index 5. The other excerpts focus on Rust adoption, general language comparisons, or corporate adoption narratives without providing TigerBeetle-specific quantitative outcomes. Thus, the connection is partial and primarily contextual: there is related discussion of high-performance benchmarking for TigerBeetle, but no direct support for the exact quantified outcome requested in the field value.",

A passage that notes: a) Rust being used in a major system component (such as a Dropbox sync engine rewrite) and stating that choosing Rust was a force multiplier directly supports the idea that Rust adoption yields substantial positive outcomes in production code. A passage that describes a similar production adoption narrative in a case study context (for example, in a compilation of Serokell case studies) supports the notion that Rust is used for security-sensitive or high-performance components and that teams perceive security or reliability benefits from Rust. Additional passages highlighting memory-safety advantages of Rust in corporate contexts (for instance, Microsoft recounting memory-safety benefits in large C/C++ codebases) reinforce the general claim that Rust adoption improves memory-safety posture in production systems. Finally, passages that discuss performance improvements and latency benefits (such as Discord's comparison between Go and Rust, or Firecracker's Rust-based implementation) provide supporting context for broad production-quality benefits of Rust.\n\nFrom these, the strongest direct alignments are: the production rewrite of core infrastructure with Rust cited as a force multiplier, and explicit production-focused case studies discussing security and memory-safety implications of choosing Rust. The other excerpts extend the narrative to broader production and security advantages and performance, which are supportive but less directly tied to the exact quantified Android memory-safety metric.\n",

The most directly supportive excerpts state that Mojo is a pythonic language designed for blazing-fast CPU+GPU execution and that it avoids CUDA usage, with claims that the same code runs everywhere and that no HIP or CUDA is required. Additional excerpts reinforce the portability and GPU-oriented programming goals by describing Mojo as suitable for kernels across CPUs, GPUs, and ASICs, and by highlighting vendor-independent GPU programmability. Some excerpts also place Mojo in the context of extending Python ecosystems and aligning with modern tooling (e.g., nanobind), which is consistent with a Python-superset approach. While none of the excerpts explicitly enumerates all the precise memory-safety ownership model, absence of a garbage collector, zero-cost traits, or the MLIR-based compiler, the combined statements about Pythonic design, high-performance GPU/CPU execution without CUDA, and cross-hardware portability provide coherent support for the core aspects of the field value. Overall, the most relevant sources directly address the Python-ness, performance characteristics, CUDA avoidance, and portability that resemble the described differentiators, while slightly less directly supporting the memory-safety and MLIR/ownership details. This yields a medium-to-high coherence overall, with evidence strongest on the broad architectural and portability claims and weaker on the exact memory-management and compiler-implementation specifics.",

Java was rejected since it would involve deploying JVM on their servers. 🙃🙃\n\n> The challenges that npm faces demand efficient and scalable solutions.

Additionally, we define the behavior for a limited number of\npreviously-undefined cases when an unwind operation reaches a Rust function\nboundary with a non- `\"Rust\"` , non- `\"C-unwind\"` ABI. As part of this specification, we introduce the term [“Plain Old Frame”\n(POF)](#plain-old-frames) . These are frames that have no pending destructors and\ncan be trivially deallocated. This RFC does not define the behavior of `catch_unwind` in a Rust frame being\nunwound by a foreign exception. This is something the [project\ngroup](https://github.com/rust-lang/project-ffi-unwind) would like to specify in a future RFC; as such, it is\n“TBD” (see [“Unresolved questions”](#unresolved-questions) ). # [Motivation](#motivation)",

There are also existing Rust crates (notably, wrappers around the `libpng` and `libjpeg` C libraries) that `panic` across C frames. The safety of such\nunwinding relies on compatibility between Rust’s unwinding mechanism and the\nnative exception mechanisms in GCC, LLVM, and MSVC. Despite using a compatible\nunwinding mechanism, the current `rustc` implementation assumes that `extern \"C\"` functions cannot unwind, which permits LLVM to optimize with the\nassumption that such unwinding constitutes undefined behavior.",

            "\nRust [supports a great number of platforms](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html) . For many of these platforms\nThe Rust Project publishes binary releases of the standard library, and for\nsome the full compiler. `rustup` gives easy access to all of them. When you first install a toolchain, `rustup` installs only the standard\nlibrary for your _host_ platform - that is, the architecture and operating\nsystem you are presently running. To compile to other platforms you must\ninstall other _target_ platforms. This is done with the `rustup target add` command. For example, to add the Android target:\n\n```console\n$ rustup target add arm-linux-androideabi\ninfo: downloading component 'rust-std' for 'arm-linux-androideabi'\ninfo: installing component 'rust-std' for 'arm-linux-androideabi'\n```\n\nWith the `arm-linux-androideabi` target installed you can then build for\nAndroid with Cargo by passing the `--target` flag, as in `cargo build --target=arm-linux-androideabi` . Note that `rustup target add` only installs the Rust standard library for a\ngiven target.\nThere are typically other tools necessary to cross-compile,\nparticularly a linker. For example, to cross compile to Android the [Android\nNDK](https://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html) must be installed. In the future, `rustup` will provide assistance\ninstalling the NDK components as well. See the [target section](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html) of the `cargo` configuration for how to setup a linker to use for a certain target. To install a target for a toolchain that isn’t the default toolchain use the `--toolchain` argument of `rustup target add` , like so:\n\n```console\n$ rustup target add --toolchain <toolchain> <target>...\n```\n\nTo see a list of available targets, `rustup target list` . To remove a\npreviously-added target, `rustup target remove` .",
            "With the `arm-linux-androideabi` target installed you can then build for\nAndroid with Cargo by passing the `--target` flag, as in `cargo build --target=arm-linux-androideabi` .",
            "To compile to other platforms you must install other target platforms. This is done with the rustup target add command. Cross-compilation - The rustup book",
            "```console\n$ rustup target add arm-linux-androideabi\ninfo: downloading component 'rust-std' for 'arm-linux-androideabi'\ninfo: installing component 'rust-std' for 'arm-linux-androideabi'\n```"

It discourages the use of dangerous language features, promotes best practices, and most importantly, [avoids undefined behavior](https://www.3lawsrobotics.io/post/the-importance-of-system-characterization-for-safe-cyber-physical-system-behavior)."

In the beginning he worked on it in his spare time and, once he got enough donations, he started working on it full time. Soon after, he created the [Zig Software Foundation](https://ziglang.org/zsf), a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation. Donations are now directly sent to the foundation and all financial information is [available](https://ziglang.org/zsf) to the public. Andrew is President of the board of directors alongside Mason Remaley and Josh Wolfe who are Treasurer and Secretary, respectively. What’s important to note about this arrangement, is how this restricts Andrew’s power:\n\n* The foundation has bylaws that the board needs to abide by. * Andrew can’t “run away” with the cash, like he potentially could in the beginning. It’s also equally important to understand how this arrangement does not directly impact Andrew’s decisional power when it comes to the design of the language. The board is there mostly to provide long-term stability, and it does not have a say on whether Zig should allow hard tabs or not, for example. When it comes to design, Andrew still reserves the right to be the ultimate decision maker, but he’s not doing all design work alone. Designing Zig\n=============\n\nFrom the moment Zig became available to the public, the GitHub repository started hosting Issues tagged `proposal`, submitted by either Andrew himself or people that wanted to get involved with the project.",

Understanding Zig\n=================\n\nI think the best way for me to expand on this final point is to refer to how I approached the project in the beginning. Concrete outcome\n----------------\n\nAt its core, Zig is a programming language with an opinionated design and a clear goal. If you don’t care about manual memory management, architectures other than the latest Intel i9, executable size and general resource efficiency, then Zig is probably not for you. In my case, comptime is the feature that clicked first as I read the [Zig overview](https://ziglang.org/learn/overview/) on the official website.",

The most directly supportive excerpts are those explicitly detailing the C23/C23 standard evolution, the nature of C23 changes, and the status of compiler toolchain support for C/C++ across GCC, Clang/LLVM, and MSVC. Specifically, excerpts outlining the release and content of C23, the features introduced by C23 (e.g., static_assert, type support, new keywords), and references to compiler/toolchain enhancements (sanitizers, static analysis, -std=c23, -std=gnu23, etc.) directly substantiate claims about modernizing C and C++ and the ecosystem's push toward memory-safety and modern tooling. The cited excerpts also mention C++23 library and language features, compiler support, and the evolution of standards committees, which together map onto the field value's assertion that C/C++ remain pivotal and are being actively modernized to compete with newer languages. The more tangential excerpts about Zig, Rust, or other ecosystems provide broader context on memory-safety and interop but are ranked lower in relevance to the exact field value focused on C/C++ evolution and tooling. The strongest, most directly relevant excerpts discuss C23 and C++23 content and compiler/toolchain adoption and are therefore placed at the top of the relevance list, followed by excerpts that address related standardization and compiler support details.",

It’s also equally important to understand how this arrangement does not directly impact Andrew’s decisional power when it comes to the design of the language. The board is there mostly to provide long-term stability, and it does not have a say on whether Zig should allow hard tabs or not, for example. When it comes to design, Andrew still reserves the right to be the ultimate decision maker, but he’s not doing all design work alone.

Concrete outcome\n----------------\n\nAt its core, Zig is a programming language with an opinionated design and a clear goal. If you don’t care about manual memory management, architectures other than the latest Intel i9, executable size and general resource efficiency, then Zig is probably not for you.

Grain and Moonbit still haven’t made it into the Top 100, but Bicep jumped eight spots to 78 and Zig 10 to 87. That progress pales next to Ballerina, however, which jumped from 80 to 61 this quarter.

The most pertinent excerpts provide: (1) surveys and industry analyses showing Rust, Go, and Zig are increasingly sought after in memory-safe, high-performance contexts within cloud infrastructure, OS, and security-critical domains; (2) explicit salary and compensation signals for languages favored in systems work (notably Zig and Rust) in 2024–2025, indicating premium pay for memory-safe language expertise; (3) evidence of large-scale corporate hiring and foundation-backed programs that fund Rust, Zig, and related ecosystems, which underpins robust open-source career pathways. Taken together, these excerpts substantiate the claim that the open-source systems programming jobs market is shifting toward memory-safe, high-performance languages (Rust, Go, Zig) with premium compensation, while traditional C/C++ roles remain but are increasingly complemented by higher-paying opportunities in newer languages. The most directly supportive excerpts describe Stack Overflow trends and salary signals for Zig and Rust, as well as industry adoption by large employers and foundations that fund these ecosystems. Less direct but supportive excerpts include broader memory-safety advocacy and corporate hiring patterns tied to Rust and Zig adoption in cloud, OS, and security-critical projects.",
