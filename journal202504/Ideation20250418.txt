Ideating libraries to rewrite in Rust under PMHLRRY Pradhan Mantri Har Library Rust Rewrite Yojna

Go to Rust 
- A good library for web scraping & crawling, a rewrite of https://github.com/gocolly/colly

Java to Rust
- Caffeine - A high-performance, in-memory caching library for Java
    - Feynman: Caffeine acts like a fast, temporary storage (cache) within your Java app. It keeps frequently accessed data readily available, avoiding slower lookups elsewhere and speeding up responses. [1]
    - Rust Equivalent Research: Yes, libraries like `moka` aim to provide similar high-performance, concurrent in-memory caching capabilities in Rust, inspired by Caffeine. Other crates like `cached` and `lru` also exist.
- Joda-Time - A date and time library for Java
    - Feynman: Joda-Time replaced Java's old, confusing date/time tools with a much clearer and more powerful system. It makes handling dates, times, durations, and time zones straightforward and less prone to errors.
    - Rust Equivalent Research: Yes, the `chrono` crate is the widely adopted standard in Rust, providing comprehensive date and time functionality similar to Joda-Time and its successor `java.time`. The `time` crate is another mature alternative.
- Joda-Money - A money and currency library for Java
    - Feynman: Joda-Money gives Java precise tools (`Money`, `CurrencyUnit`) to represent monetary values and their currencies. This avoids floating-point errors and handles currency rules like decimal places correctly. [1](https://blog.joda.org/2009/08/joda-money_806.html), [2](https://www.joda.org/joda-money/)
    - Rust Equivalent Research: Yes, crates like `rusty_money` provide similar `Money` and `Currency` types for safe monetary calculations in Rust. The `rust_decimal` crate is also commonly used for the underlying high-precision decimal arithmetic needed.
- Resilience4j - Lightweight fault tolerance library
    - Feynman: Imagine your app calls another service that might fail. Resilience4j adds safety features like automatically retrying the call or temporarily blocking calls (circuit breaking) if the service keeps failing, preventing your app from crashing.
    - Rust Equivalent Research: Yes, crates like `failsafe-rs` (inspired by Failsafe/Resilience4j), `tokio-retry`, `backoff`, and `circuit_breaker` provide similar fault tolerance patterns (retries, circuit breakers) in Rust.
- JGraphT - Graph theory algorithms and data structures
    - Feynman: JGraphT gives you tools to build and analyze networks (graphs) made of points (vertices) and connections (edges). It's like a toolbox for working with relationship maps, like social networks or road systems.
    - Rust Equivalent Research: Yes, `petgraph` is a popular and comprehensive graph library in Rust. Other crates like `graph` and `graphlib` also offer graph data structures and algorithms.
- Retrofit - Type-safe HTTP client with annotation-based API
    - Feynman: Retrofit simplifies making network requests to web APIs in Java. You define the API structure using annotations on an interface, and Retrofit generates the code to handle the actual HTTP communication.
    - Rust Equivalent Research: Yes, while not identical (annotation-driven generation is less common), `reqwest` is the de facto standard HTTP client. Combining `reqwest` with `serde` for JSON handling is typical. Crates like `refract` aim for a more declarative style, and gRPC frameworks like `tonic` offer type-safe RPC.
- AssertJ - Fluent assertions with rich failure messages
    - Feynman: AssertJ makes writing tests in Java more readable and provides clearer error messages when tests fail. Instead of basic checks, you write expressive statements like `assertThat(name).startsWith("Fro")`.
    - Rust Equivalent Research: Yes, Rust has built-in `assert!`, `assert_eq!`. For more fluent or expressive assertions similar to AssertJ, crates like `assert_matches`, `pretty_assertions`, and `claim` exist.
- Jimfs - In-memory file system implementation
    - Feynman: Jimfs creates a temporary file system that lives only in your computer's memory, not on the actual disk. This allows tests that need to read/write files to run quickly and without affecting the real file system.
    - Rust Equivalent Research: Yes, crates like `memfs`, `vfs` (Virtual File System abstractions often with in-memory backends), and `tempfile` (for temporary files/dirs on disk, but often used in testing) provide ways to handle file operations in tests, including in-memory approaches.
- ModelMapper - Object mapping that doesn't require configuration
    - Feynman: ModelMapper automatically copies data between different Java objects that have similar field names (e.g., from a database record to a web response object). It intelligently matches fields, reducing the need for manual copying code.
    - Rust Equivalent Research: Partially. Rust's strong typing often favors explicit mapping. However, crates like `mapstruct` (using procedural macros) or combining `serde` (for serialization/deserialization) with struct conversions (`From`/`Into` traits) can achieve similar goals, though often requiring more explicit definitions than ModelMapper's convention-based approach.
- Failsafe - Circuit breaking and retry policies
    - Feynman: Failsafe acts as a safety mechanism for operations that might fail, like network calls. It lets you define rules for automatically retrying failed attempts or temporarily stopping attempts (circuit breaking) to prevent system overload.
    - Rust Equivalent Research: Yes, similar to Resilience4j, crates like `failsafe-rs`, `tokio-retry`, `backoff`, and `circuit_breaker` provide these fault tolerance patterns in Rust.
- Thumbnailator - Simple, efficient image manipulation library
    - Feynman: Thumbnailator is a Java tool focused on making it easy to create thumbnail versions of images. It simplifies common tasks like resizing and cropping images with minimal code.
    - Rust Equivalent Research: Yes, the `image` crate is the most prominent Rust library for general image encoding, decoding, and manipulation, including resizing. Crates like `resize` specialize in fast image resizing algorithms.



JavaScript to Rust
- A generic library for general helpers like slice, map, channels like lodash which actually enables functional programming patterns in Rust. Think of it as a utility belt that makes common operations more concise. Imagine you're working with collections in Rust - this library would provide simple, chainable methods to transform data. For example, instead of writing verbose iterator chains, you could use intuitive methods like `.map()`, `.filter()`, and `.reduce()` that work consistently across different collection types. The key insight is that while Rust already has powerful iterators, a lodash-like library would provide a more approachable, consistent API that feels familiar to developers coming from JavaScript, making the transition to Rust smoother while maintaining Rust's performance and safety guarantees.
