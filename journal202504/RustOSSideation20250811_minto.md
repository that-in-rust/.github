## Consolidation of `RustOSSideation20250811.md` (Minto Pyramid)

### Executive Answer (Top-line)
**Build a partitioned hybrid runtime in Rust**: isolate CPU cores for a specialized `#![no_std]` runtime with direct hardware access (via VFIO and IOMMU) while Linux manages non-critical tasks on host cores. This delivers predictable low latency and high throughput for targeted workloads (network packet processing, NVMe I/O), with a pragmatic MVP and clear benchmarking to validate performance claims.

### Key Supporting Themes (Grouped)
| **Theme** | **Why it matters** | **Techniques** | **Trade-offs** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Partitioned execution | Removes scheduler/IRQ jitter for determinism | `isolcpus`, `nohz_full`, `rcu_nocbs`, IRQ affinity, cpusets/cgroups | Reduced general-purpose flexibility; ops complexity |
| Kernel bypass | Cuts syscalls, copies; unlocks direct device control | VFIO, MMIO, DMA, huge pages, NUMA pinning | Driver complexity, safety/security burden |
| Rust `#![no_std]` runtime | Tight control, predictable allocation & scheduling | cooperative or RT-like scheduler; custom allocator; volatile MMIO | More unsafe code; limited tooling; harder debugging |
| Use-case focus | Clear metrics, faster iteration | L2/L3 forwarder, NIDS, NVMe storage, market data feed | Narrow scope may limit generality |
| Observability | Safe iteration on perf/stability | shared-memory logging, rdtsc timers, perf/ftrace on host | Extra engineering, potential perturbation |
| Security & safety | Mitigate risks of user-space drivers | IOMMU groups, privilege drop, input validation, watchdogs | Residual risk; careful audit required |

---

### Landscape of Approaches (Protecting idea diversity)
| **Approach** | **Pros** | **Cons/Risks** | **Maturity** | **MVP fit** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Conventional Linux tuning (XDP/AF_XDP, io_uring) | Fast to ship; rich tooling | Residual jitter; kernel path limits ultimate determinism | High | Good baseline only |
| Partitioned hybrid runtime (selected) | Deterministic perf; flexible data plane | VFIO/device complexity; ops burden | Medium | Excellent |
| Microkernel/unikernel from scratch | Maximal control, educational value | Very long path to usable drivers | Low | Poor for MVP |
| Dynamic “fluid” partitioning | Adapts cores by load | Policy complexity; verification | Low/experimental | Future |
| TEEs + kernel-bypass (confidential I/O) | Strong isolation | Device/TEE attestation integration is hard | Low/medium | Future |
| RDMA-focused data plane | Ultra-low latency networking | HW dependence; niche | Medium | Niche |
| Storage-centric (SPDK-like in Rust) | Clear benchmarks; fewer NIC quirks | NVMe spec/driver work | Medium | Good alternative |

### MVP Use Cases (from the document)
| **Use case** | **Objective metric** | **Why chosen** | **Primary device** |
|---|---|---|---|
| L2/L3 packet forwarder | p99 latency ≤ 2–5 µs; 10GbE line rate (14.88 Mpps) | Classic kernel-bypass showcase | NIC via VFIO |

### Risk Register (consolidated)

---

### Decision Criteria (Go/No-Go)
| **Criterion** | **Threshold** |
|---|---|
| Tail latency reduction | ≥5× p99 improvement vs baseline |
| Throughput gain | ≥1.5× on chosen workload |
| Stability | ≥24h soak without fault on certified HW |
| Safety | IOMMU enforced; no DMA escapes in tests |
| Operability | Start/stop, logs, metrics, reset flow |

---

### Recommended MVP (minimal scope)
- **Scope**: Single NIC OR single NVMe device on one certified machine (Lenovo Legion Y540).
- **Runtime**: `#![no_std]` core with cooperative scheduler, bump allocator.
- **Driver**: VFIO polled path, essential MMIO/DMA only.
- **Observability**: rdtsc latency histograms; shared-memory logs.
- **Bench**: Side-by-side with XDP (NIC) or io_uring (NVMe).

### Alternative Tracks to Preserve (do not discard)
| **Track** | **When to explore** | **Trigger** |
|---|---|---|
| EDF/RMS preemption | After cooperative MVP meets goals | Complex multi-tasking required |
| RDMA path | If NIC VFIO blocked by HW | Needs RDMA NICs |
| TEE + passthrough | Regulated workloads; confidentiality | Security requirements |
| Fluid partitioning | After stable ops baseline | Dynamic workloads |

---

### One-page Narrative (Minto stack)
- **Answer**: Use a partitioned hybrid Rust runtime with kernel-bypass on isolated cores to deliver deterministic low latency and higher throughput for a focused workload.
- **Reasons**: Linux jitter persists even with tuning; partitioning + VFIO provides predictability; Rust `#![no_std]` keeps control and safety; a narrow MVP yields fast proof and iterates risk down.
- **Evidence**: Documented plans detail CPU isolation, driver model, scheduler, allocator, IPC, and benchmarks; expected gains: 5–10× p99 latency, 1.5–3× throughput; risk mitigations via IOMMU, watchdogs, audits; multiple use cases proven in prior art (DPDK/SPDK analogs) and within this doc’s variants.
