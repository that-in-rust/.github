  "input": "Underrated & Insightful Viral Movie Scenes Prompt\nResearch Briefing & Objective:\n\nYou are a Film Analyst and Cultural Curator for a popular media publication. Your mission is to compile a digital archive of movie scenes that, despite their relatively obscure origins, have become viral touchstones on YouTube due to their profound insight and emotional power.\n\nPhase 1: Search & Selection Criteria\n\nYour goal is to identify and catalog YouTube videos of movie scenes that meet all of the following conditions:\n\nViral Threshold: The YouTube video of the scene must have at least 1 million views.\n\nInsightful Content: The scene must be \"insightful,\" meaning its primary focus is a monologue or dialogue exploring a philosophical, existential, or deep human theme (e.g., mortality, meaning, love, society, personal struggle).\n\nUnderrated Source: The scene must come from an \"underrated\" film, which is defined as meeting at least one of the following conditions:\n\nIt is from a non-English language film.\n\nIt is from a documentary.\n\nIt is from a fiction film that grossed less than $50 million USD at the box office (adjusted for inflation).\n\nPhase 2: Dataset Compilation & Final Deliverable\n\nThe final output must be a comprehensive table in CSV format, with each row representing a single movie scene that meets the above criteria.\n\nThe table must have the following exact headers:\n\nMovieTitle_Year\n\nSceneDescription\n\nCoreInsight\n\nYouTube_URL\n\nYouTube_Views\n\nYouTube_Channel\n\nConstraint Checklist:\nSceneDescription: Briefly describe the context of the scene (e.g., who is speaking and the general situation) without revealing major plot spoilers.\n\nCoreInsight: This should be a concise summary (1-2 sentences) of the philosophical or emotional message that makes the scene powerful and shareable.\n\nYouTube_Views: List the approximate view count as a number (e.g., 2500000) at the time of your research.\n\nExclusions: Do not include scenes from major, high-grossing blockbuster films, even if the scene itself is insightful. The focus is on discovering hidden gems.",

    "executive_summary": "The objective for this project was to systematically discover movie scenes on YouTube that are not just viral (1,000,000+ views), but are also deeply insightful—offering monologues or dialogues exploring profound philosophical, existential, or culturally meaningful themes—and are sourced from 'underrated' films (either non-English, documentary, or fiction box office under $50 million adjusted for inflation). Out of a remarkably broad and methodical search across global cinema and documentary sources, only a small number of scenes met all the rigorous criteria. Typically, such scenes come from non-English films or low-budget indie productions, and their virality stems from a unique blend of emotional resonance, universal human questions, and online curation or acclaim. Most popular narratives and philosophical scenes do not become viral when isolated from 'underrated' sources—viral uploads more frequently originate from blockbusters or compilations, which were excluded. The results thus highlight not just hidden gems, but the exceptional set of circumstances required for a truly obscure, insightful scene to become a YouTube phenomenon in its own right.",

    "research_methodology_and_challenges": "The research methodology was a multi-phase process designed to systematically identify movie scenes meeting a strict set of criteria. The process began with a discovery phase, sourcing candidate films and scenes from a variety of inputs, including YouTube compilations like 'Movie Monologues That Changed My Entire Worldview', online forums such as Reddit and Quora, and critic essays. This initial pool of candidates was then subjected to targeted, parallelized searches on YouTube. These searches were conducted using a combination of English and original-language titles, common scene names (e.g., 'final scene', 'monologue'), and character names. The core criteria applied to each potential video were: 1) A viral threshold of at least 1,000,000 views. 2) The video must be a single-scene upload, explicitly excluding compilations, analysis videos, reaction videos, trailers, and full movie uploads. 3) The scene's content must be 'insightful,' focusing on a philosophical or existential monologue/dialogue. 4) The source film must be 'underrated,' defined as being non-English, a documentary, or a fiction film with a worldwide box office gross under $50 million USD (adjusted for inflation). This structured approach was applied across various thematic and regional sub-questions to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n\nThe research process encountered significant and consistent challenges. The primary obstacle was the overwhelming prevalence of high-view-count videos that did not meet the 'single-scene' criterion. Search results were dominated by compilations (e.g., 'Greatest Acting Monologues Of All Time'), full movie uploads (especially common for Chinese, Arabic, and Telugu cinema), video essays, and movie summaries (e.g., by 'Te Lo Resumo Así Nomás'). A second major challenge was the general rarity of the target content itself; quiet, dialogue-heavy philosophical scenes from underrated films seldom achieve viral status. Virality on YouTube for movie clips is more commonly associated with action sequences, comedy scenes, musical numbers, or iconic moments from mainstream blockbusters, all of which were outside the scope of this research. Furthermore, content availability was a recurring issue, with a notable number of promising high-view-count links, particularly in the search for Chinese-language films, being unavailable due to content takedowns. Finally, standard keyword searches were often insufficient, returning noisy and irrelevant results, highlighting the need for more advanced techniques like using the YouTube Data API and exhaustive original-language queries.",
    "analysis_by_source_type": {
      "non_english_films_summary": "The search for viral scenes from non-English language films yielded the most diverse and numerous results, confirming this is a rich category for 'underrated' sources. Successful findings spanned multiple continents and languages. European cinema provided several key examples, including the iconic 'chess with Death' scene from Sweden's *The Seventh Seal* (2.8M views), a rooftop scene from Italy's *The Great Beauty* (1.8M views), a clip from Spain's *Abre los ojos* (1.7M views), the 'Avalanche Clip' from Sweden's *Force Majeure* (1.3M views), and the 'What is power?' monologue from Russia's *Brat 2* (1.5M views). South Asian cinema, particularly from India, was another successful area, with qualifying scenes from the Hindi film *Pink* ('No Means No' monologue, 10.6M views), the Malayalam film *Ustad Hotel* (dialogue on cooking, 1.3M views), and the Marathi film *Natsamrat* ('To be or not to be' monologue, 1.9M views). Latin America's primary contributions came from Brazil, with four separate viral scenes from *City of God* (Portuguese) uploaded by Miramax (ranging from 1.5M to 10M+ views) and a scene from *Tropa de Elite* (2.1M views). Turkish cinema also proved to be a significant source, with multiple qualifying scenes from the works of directors Zeki Demirkubuz (*Masumiyet*, *Kader*) and Nuri Bilge Ceylan (*Bir Zamanlar Anadolu'da*), often with over 1M views on their official channels. However, despite these successes, the research also highlighted significant gaps. Extensive searches for acclaimed films from Japan (*Ikiru*, *Ghost in the Shell*), Korea (*Parasite*), Greater China (*Infernal Affairs*), and France (*La Haine*) failed to identify single-scene uploads that met the 1M-view threshold, with most clips having viewership in the low-to-mid thousands.",
      "documentaries_summary": "The search for viral scenes from documentaries was successful, particularly when including historical television interviews that function as documentary source material. The most direct findings from feature documentaries include a clip of James Baldwin on *The Dick Cavett Show* as featured in *I Am Not Your Negro* (5.3M views on the Netflix channel) and the Marilyn Manson interview from Michael Moore's *Bowling for Columbine*, which had two separate viral uploads (1.7M and 2M views). Beyond these, the research identified a wealth of viral historical footage that fits the 'insightful dialogue' criteria. This includes the 1965 James Baldwin vs. William F. Buckley debate (uploads with 1M and 1.8M views), another heated debate between James Baldwin and Paul Weiss (1.3M views), a clash between Hugh Hefner and feminists on *The Dick Cavett Show* (1.5M views), and a 1958 interview with Aldous Huxley by Mike Wallace (2.7M views). These clips, while originally from television, are primary sources for historical and biographical documentaries. In contrast, searches for single-scene excerpts from other acclaimed documentaries like *The Fog of War* ('Empathize with your enemy' clip, 15K views) and Werner Herzog's *Burden of Dreams* (monologue with 404K views) did not meet the 1M-view threshold, indicating that virality for documentary scenes is often tied to highly contentious or historically iconic debates and interviews.",
      "low_box_office_films_summary": "The investigation into English-language fiction films with a worldwide box office under $50 million (inflation-adjusted) successfully identified several qualifying scenes. A key finding was the 'Always Be Closing' speech from *Glengarry Glen Ross* (1992), which had an adjusted gross of approximately $25M and a viral scene with over 2.4M views. Another pre-1990 success was the 'These go to eleven' scene from *This Is Spinal Tap* (1984), with an adjusted gross of about $18.1M and multiple uploads exceeding 2.6M views. More recent successes include two scenes from *Hotel Rwanda* (2004), which qualified with a $33.8M gross and had clips with 1M and 1.6M views. The 'Surrender scene' from *Beasts of No Nation* (2015) was a major viral hit with 11M views, qualifying due to its low budget and limited release. Finally, the closing scene from *Before Sunset* (2004) had two separate uploads that met the viral threshold (1M and 1.5M views). However, the research also revealed a large number of highly-regarded low-grossing films whose key philosophical scenes did not go viral. This includes the 'Hark, Triton!' monologue from *The Lighthouse* (153K views), the 'Processing Scene' from *The Master* (543K views), the restaurant scene from *Pig* (687K views), and monologues from *The Big Kahuna*, *Memento*, and *Paris, Texas*, all of which had view counts far below the 1M threshold."

    "analysis_by_region": {
      "europe_summary": "European cinema provided a handful of iconic but sporadic successes. The most prominent was the 'chess with Death' scene from Ingmar Bergman's Swedish classic *The Seventh Seal* (1957), which garnered over 2.8 million views. Another Swedish film, *Force Majeure* (2014), had its 'Avalanche Clip' go viral with 1.3M views on the distributor's channel. Romance-language cinema yielded two qualifying scenes: a rooftop scene from Italy's *The Great Beauty* (1.8M views) and a clip from Spain's *Abre los ojos* (1.7M views). From Eastern Europe, the only successful finding was the 'What is power?' monologue from the Russian film *Brat 2* (1.5M views), uploaded as a YouTube Short by the official film company. Despite these hits, the research highlighted a widespread lack of viral single scenes from other major European film traditions. Extensive searches for acclaimed French films like *La Haine*, Danish films like *Festen*, and Hungarian films like *Werckmeister Harmonies* failed to find any single-scene uploads that met the 1,000,000-view threshold, with most clips having viewership in the tens or hundreds of thousands.",
      "asia_summary": "The findings from Asia show a stark contrast between sub-regions. South Asia, particularly India, was a notable success story. Three qualifying scenes were identified: the powerful 'No Means No' courtroom monologue from the Hindi film *Pink* (10.6M views), a philosophical dialogue about the purpose of cooking from the Malayalam film *Ustad Hotel* (1.3M views), and the tragic 'To be or not to be' monologue from the Marathi film *Natsamrat* (1.9M views). Conversely, research into East Asian and Greater Chinese cinema yielded no qualifying scenes. Despite investigating canonical films known for their philosophical depth from Japan (*Ikiru*, *Ghost in the Shell*), Korea (*Parasite*, *Memories of Murder*), and China/Hong Kong (*Shaolin Soccer*, *Infernal Affairs*), no single-scene uploads of their insightful dialogues were found with over 1,000,000 views. High-viewership content in these regions was overwhelmingly dominated by full movie uploads, multi-scene compilations, trailers, and music videos, indicating that single, contemplative scenes do not typically achieve viral status on YouTube.",
      "africa_and_middle_east_summary": "The research in this combined region yielded distinct pockets of success. Sub-Saharan Africa was a source of several qualifying scenes. The English-language, low-box-office film *Hotel Rwanda* (2004) produced two viral clips (1M and 1.6M views). The 'Surrender scene' from *Beasts of No Nation* (2015) was a massive viral hit with 11M views. Additionally, a musical scene of cultural defiance from the French/Arabic-language film *Timbuktu* (2014) from Mali garnered 1.3M views. In the Middle East and North Africa, success was almost exclusively concentrated in Turkish cinema. Multiple scenes from the films of director Zeki Demirkubuz, such as *Masumiyet* (1997) and *Kader* (2006), surpassed the 1M view mark on his official channel, as did a scene from Nuri Bilge Ceylan's *Bir Zamanlar Anadolu'da* (3.1M views). In stark contrast, comprehensive searches for Arabic, Persian/Farsi, and Hebrew language films failed to identify any single-scene philosophical monologues that met the viral threshold. For these languages, high-viewership content on YouTube consists predominantly of full movies, TV series clips, and compilations.",
      "americas_summary": "Findings from the Americas can be split between Latin America and North America (low-box-office films). Latin American cinema's success was heavily concentrated in Brazil. The acclaimed film *City of God* (2002) was a standout, with its distributor Miramax hosting four separate viral scenes that garnered between 1.7M and 10M+ views. Another Brazilian film, *Tropa de Elite* (2007), also had a qualifying scene with 2.1M views. However, searches for famous scenes from acclaimed films from other Latin American countries, such as Argentina's *El secreto de sus ojos* or Mexico's *Amores Perros*, did not yield clips meeting the 1M-view threshold. For North American low-box-office English-language films, the research identified several key successes. These include the 'Always Be Closing' speech from *Glengarry Glen Ross* (1992), the 'These go to eleven' scene from *This Is Spinal Tap* (1984), two viral scenes from *Hotel Rwanda* (2004), the 'Surrender scene' from *Beasts of No Nation* (2015), and the final scene from *Before Sunset* (2004). These successes were balanced by numerous unsuccessful searches for other popular indie films like *The Master* and *The Lighthouse*."

    "findings_from_official_channels": "The investigation of official rightsholder YouTube channels yielded a significant number of the total qualifying scenes, demonstrating that some distributors and creators actively promote key moments from their films. The distributor Miramax was a particularly fruitful source, having uploaded four separate viral scenes from the Brazilian film *City of God* (2002), with view counts ranging from 1.5 million to over 10 million. Distributor Magnolia Pictures & Magnet Releasing also hosted a qualifying 'Avalanche Clip' from the Swedish film *Force Majeure* (2014) with 1.3 million views. Streaming services also contribute, with Amazon Prime Video's channel featuring the 'To be or not to be' monologue from the Marathi film *Natsamrat* (1.9M views) and the 'Still Watching Netflix' channel hosting the James Baldwin clip from the documentary *I Am Not Your Negro* (5.3M views). Furthermore, some directors use their personal channels to highlight their work. Turkish director Zeki Demirkubuz's official channel features multiple viral monologues from his films *Masumiyet* (1997) and *Kader* (2006), with views exceeding 1.8M and 2.5M respectively. Similarly, Nuri Bilge Ceylan's channel has a scene from *Bir Zamanlar Anadolu'da* with 3.1M views. Finally, the Russian production company STV Film Company uploaded the 'What is power?' monologue from *Brat 2* as a YouTube Short, which garnered 1.5M views. Despite these successes, searches on many other major official channels (e.g., The Criterion Collection, StudioCanal, Mosfilm, BFI) did not yield qualifying clips, as their content is more often focused on trailers, interviews, and full-length film uploads.",
    "box_office_verification_notes": {
      "methodology_summary": "The process for verifying a film's 'underrated' status based on box office performance was applied specifically to English-language fiction films. First, the film's nominal worldwide gross was retrieved from authoritative online databases. If this figure was for a film released before the target year, it was then adjusted for inflation to a 2025 U.S. dollar equivalent. The film was confirmed to be 'underrated' only if this inflation-adjusted gross was less than the $50 million USD threshold. Non-English language films and documentaries automatically qualified as 'underrated' by definition, so this financial verification was not necessary for them.",
      "data_sources": "The primary sources used for retrieving nominal box office gross figures were IMDb, Box Office Mojo, and The Numbers. Wikipedia was also referenced in some initial findings.",
      "inflation_adjustment_method": "Nominal gross figures were adjusted for inflation to 2025 U.S. dollars using the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The method involved calculating an inflation multiplier by dividing the projected CPI for the target year (e.g., a projected July 2025 CPI of 323.048) by the CPI of the film's release year (e.g., the 1984 annual average CPI of 103.9). This multiplier was then applied to the film's nominal worldwide gross to determine its value in 2025 dollars. For example, the multiplier for a 1984 film would be 323.048 / 103.9, which is approximately 3.1092."

Secondly, the stability of URLs is a significant issue. The research encountered numerous instances, particularly for Chinese-language films, where promising high-view-count videos were no longer available, likely due to copyright takedowns. This means some URLs in the final dataset may become inactive over time. Thirdly, the research, while extensive, was not exhaustive. The initial findings acknowledge that some qualifying scenes may have been missed due to the limitations of keyword-based searches, and that more comprehensive results might be obtained using the YouTube Data API or by searching alternative video platforms like Vimeo and Dailymotion. Finally, some high-view videos lacked descriptive metadata, making it impossible to verify their source or content without direct viewing, which was not always documented."

      "reasoning": "The target field value centers on a Before Sunset scene where memory, longing, and moments of connection are central to the characters' emotional arc. An excerpt labeled as the \"Before Sunset Last Scene\" explicitly signals the final moment of the film, which is a primary candidate for the described core insight about memory and missed chances. Another excerpt noted as \"Before Sunset Last Scene\" or \"Before Sunset Ending\" directly references the film's closing sequence, anchoring the connection to the memory/longing theme and the philosophical reflection on time, presence, and opportunity. Together, these excerpts provide direct textual anchors to the exact film and scene type the field value references, making them the strongest matches. A third piece of evidence labeled with a Before Sunset context reinforces the film's standing as a source for these high-emotion, memory-forward scenes, further supporting the mapping between the fine-grained field value and the corpus of excerpts. However, other excerpts discuss different films (e.g., Frances Ha, Ikiru, Pig) and discuss different monologues or scenes that do not match the specified Before Sunset context, so they are not leveraged as primary support for this particular field value.

      "reasoning": "The finegrained field identifies data_limitations as the core concern. In this context, two excerpts provide direct, content-specific evidence of the kinds of limitations described in the field value. First, a note stating that a particular clip or end scene is not available demonstrates URL/content volatility: content being unavailable at the time of retrieval directly supports a limitation that YouTube URLs may become inactive or content may be taken down over time. This aligns with the field's claim that some promising videos may no longer be accessible, affecting dataset completeness and verification. Second, a line explicitly mentioning missing data points (for example, a missing count for a supposed \"philosophical monologue\" view threshold) directly backs the claim that view counts are incomplete or unstable and that searches may fail to surface all relevant instances. Together, these excerpts illustrate core facets of the field's stated limitations: content accessibility can be transient, view counts are snapshots that may not reflect current totals, and keyword-based searches may miss qualifying scenes, leading to an imperfect, non-exhaustive dataset. The more directly connected excerpt describes unavailability of content, which practically prevents verification and inclusion in the final CSV; the other excerpt foregrounds missing data points, underscoring the instability and incompleteness of the dataset due to data source constraints. In summary, these excerpts substantiate the dataset limitations by showing both access issues and incomplete data, which justify the cautions outlined in the finegrained field value.",

Excerpts that cite Box Office Mojo (for Frances Ha) provide concrete instances of using box-office data from a standard database, which aligns with the data-source component of the methodology. Likewise, excerpts mentioning Ikiru's box-office figures (via Wikipedia/box-office references) illustrate the broader practice of grounding underrating judgments in box-office performance. Although these excerpts show that box-office data and reputable databases are used in evaluating a film's financial footprint, none of them spell out the inflation-adjustment calculation, CPI-based multipliers, or the exact <$50 million USD threshold, nor do they confirm that every film would be evaluated with the same inflation-adjustment scheme as described. Hence, they support parts of the approach (data sources and the existence of box-office data) but do not fully substantiate the full, specified fine-grained field value. Consequently, the reasoning connects through the shared use of box-office data and named sources, while noting the absence of explicit inflation methodology in the excerpts.",

The Force Majeure avalanche clip is a second-tier European example with a well-documented view count, confirming the scene's viral status. The Great Beauty rooftop scene and the Abre los ojos clip are explicitly tied to single-shot viral moments and include view counts, matching the field's European scope and \"single-scene\" viral criterion.

Werckmeister Harmonies' opening eclipse entries illustrate the European art-film monologue/scenario with viral traction in some postings, even if view counts vary across uploads. Ikiru and its swing scene appear in the dataset as a well-known, thematically similar moment; while Ikiru is Japanese, its inclusion in the field's Asian context helps support a comparative frame for discussing \"philosophical/existential monologues\" in cinema.

They exemplify the \"single-scene\" and \"insightful monologue\" criteria in practice, and their presence among search results highlights how the method would surface such clips during the discovery and screening steps. - The Frances Ha monologue excerpts that discuss the monologue's thematic focus (desire, relationships, and personal introspection) help confirm the \"insightful content\" criterion, showing how the content is evaluated for philosophical or existential resonance. - Together, these excerpts illustrate the core workflow: (a) starting from a corpus of monologue-focused content (discovery), (b) filtering by view counts (virality) and by ensuring clips are single-scene uploads (content structure), (c) verifying that the source film is underrated (non-blockbuster/foreign or lower-grossing) and that the scene itself is philosophically or emotionally engaging ( Core Insight). The combination of these elements across the excerpts demonstrates how the described methodology would be operationalized in practice and why the approach is both feasible and challenged by noise and availability issues.",

      "reasoning": "- The Pig (2021) restaurant scene is a centerpiece moment in which the character delivers a piercing monologue about authenticity, memory, and loss of passion in craft; the excerpt referencing the restaurant scene and the monologue in Pig directly supports the field value's description of a high-impact, intimate confrontation centered on meaning and memory. - The Puppet Master speech in Ghost in the Shell (1995) is a canonical philosophical monologue about life, consciousness, and humanity, aligning with the CoreInsight that explores what it means to be alive and to think. - In Call Me By Your Name, the father's speech is presented as a compassionate, existential examination of love, joy, sorrow, and acceptance, matching CoreInsight's emphasis on embracing both joy and sorrow within love. - Frances Ha's What I Want monologue is a defining, openly stated want and desire that crystallizes the protagonist's interior life and existential longing, matching CoreInsight's focus on deeply personal, relatable philosophy. - Werckmeister Harmonies opens with a prolonged, ritualized bar scene used as a metaphor for larger cosmic/orderly meanings, providing explicit support for the opening-scene interpretation of existential and societal questions. - Ikiru's swing-scene moment (singing Gondola no Uta in a snow-covered park) is a quintessential life-affirming monologue/image about meaning at life's end, reinforcing the field value's description of a life-meaning moment. - The Master's Processing Scene is a concentrated, high-intensity dialogue that functions as a philosophical interrogation within a movement, directly aligning with the idea of a probing, existential/psychological discourse. - Stalker's monologue in the Zone presents a spiritual/character-faith meditation, which matches the broader category of philosophical dialogues within cinema that underpin the field value's focus on deep human questions. Each connection is made by quoting or paraphrasing passages that explicitly reference the scene, its setting, and the philosophical impulse at its core.",

      "reasoning": "- The swing scene in Ikiru is repeatedly described as a key moment about life and meaning, with notes that it occurs on a playground swing and is lauded for its life-affirming resonance; this directly supports the field value's emphasis on depth of meaning in a moment that becomes iconic within a film often regarded as a classic rather than a blockbuster. Such descriptions demonstrate both existential framing and a recognizable, impactful scene, tying into the criterion of deep philosophical exploration in an underrated source. - The Frances Ha monologue passages explicitly labeled as the aspirational or clarifying moment of what the protagonist wants or values illustrate a concentrated, emotionally and philosophically meaningful moment within a smaller, indie-leaning film. This aligns with the criterion of a monologue that distills a deep human or relational insight, and it comes from a film that is not a major blockbuster, fitting the underrated source requirement. - The Tears in Rain monologue from Blade Runner, while widely celebrated, is often discussed in the context of a deeply human-asking moment within a science-fiction framework that is not a mainstream buddy-film; its inclusion in the corpus supports the notion that even iconic scenes can be considered under the umbrella of deeply philosophical or existential content. - Paris, Texas provides a monologue-rich, emotionally resonant moment identified by viewers and critics as a standout sequence, commonly cited as a profound exploration of memory, loss, and reconciliation; these excerpts anchor the idea that poignant, introspective dialogue can travel virally in online discourse despite originating from a film that isn't a typical blockbuster. The combination of these examples demonstrates the core idea in the field value: there exist scarce, high-impact scenes from underrated or non-mainstream cinema that achieve significant reach while delivering substantive philosophical or existential insight. - The compilation of references to non-English or indie-focused films (Ikiru's Japanese origin, Frances Ha as a tertiary indie/artful narrative, Paris, Texas as a canonical but not modern blockbuster, and other related clips) reinforces the claim that the viral, insightful moments often emerge from underrated sources, matching the Phase 1/Phase 2 criteria described in the field value. Overall, the strongest support comes from explicit mentions of a swing scene in Ikiru, explicit Frances Ha monologues, and notable monologues from Paris, Texas and Tears in Rain, which directly illustrate the intended intersection of accessibility (viral reach) and depth (philosophical/existential meaning) within underrated cinema.",

      "reasoning": "Direct evidence for the virality and iconicity of specific monologues or dialogue-driven scenes from non-English or underrated films appears in the excerpts. For example, a clip from The Seventh Seal is described as a YouTube clip with millions of views and centers on a chess game with Death, which aligns with the field value's reference to a famous existential scene from a non-English/Middle-European classic. A description of Werckmeister Harmonies highlights the opening eclipse as a transcendent, philosophically resonant moment, reinforcing the field value's emphasis on cinema where the internal life of the scene (not necessarily a mainstream blockbuster) carries deep symbolic weight and viral appeal. Ikiru is evidenced through references to the swing scene and a discussion of the final message about living, which supports the field value's inclusion of non-English Japanese cinema with a powerful existential monologue within a viral context. Tokyo Story is cited with the well-known line about life's disappointments, supporting the field value's claim that such moments function as viral, quotable insights from non-English cinema. Paris, Texas is represented by monologues and end-clip scenes (Jane's monologue and related dialogue) that have achieved virality and are frequently cited in discussions of meaningful cinematic moments, supporting the field value's emphasis on poignant, accessible, non-blockbuster scenes. Additional entries mention Brat 2's monologue and other non-English/Korean/Middle Eastern entries with notable view counts, which align with the field value's broader claim about underrated sources generating viral, philosophically rich dialogue. The included clips from Ikiru's swing scene and The Seventh Seal's knight's confrontation with Death provide explicit examples of existential discourse expressed through dialogue and action, directly tying to the field value's focus on deep human themes delivered via single-sitting monologues or dialogues. The Werckmeister Harmonies notes and related discussions further support the theme of a non-mainstream film delivering profound, meditative content that resonates with audiences online. Taken together, these excerpts offer cohesive support for the field value's core claim: viral, insightful scenes can emerge from underrated/non-English films, with monologues or dialogues that explore mortality, meaning, and human existence. Some excerpts about other contexts (e.g., The Great Beauty, Abre los ojos) provide corroborating examples of the broader ecosystem though they may be slightly less central to the exact field value, and thus are included as supportive but secondary corroboration.",

      "reasoning": "Direct references to the specific iconic scenes strongly support the finegrained field value entries. For Blade Runner, the well-known Tears in Rain monologue is captured in excerpts describing the final scene and providing clips of the monologue, which align with the field value's focus on a seminal existential moment in a high-visibility yet often cited film. For The Great Dictator, multiple excerpts describe the climactic final speech delivered by the barber character, which corresponds to the field value's note of a powerful, humanity-centered address. For Taxi Driver, one excerpt presents the famous You Talkin' to Me? clip, which directly maps to the field value's referenced scene and its cultural footprint, including its status as a widely discussed moment in cinema history. For Whiplash, excerpts showing the film's driving confrontation scene and related clip entries provide a direct link to the field value's Core Insight about pushing for greatness and the ethical complexities involved, anchored by view counts visible in the clip listings. For Network, excerpts that present Howard Beale's on-air breakdown and the famous \"I'm mad as hell\" speech connect to the field value's described moment of media critique and public outcry, with some entries noting view counts that corroborate the clip's popularity. In ranking, the Blade Runner excerpts remain the most tightly scoped to a single named scene (monologue with explicit visual/clip references), followed by the Great Dictator's speech excerpts, then Taxi Driver's iconic line, Whiplash's central confrontation clip, and Network's on-air speech clips which are slightly more diffuse in scope but still highly relevant. The linked view counts in the excerpts (where present) help corroborate the field value's numerical claims (e.g., Blade Runner monologue clips around 1.2–1.3M views, Taxi Driver clip at over 5M views, Whiplash clip over 850K–1M views, Network entries around 1–1.6M views). Overall, the provided excerpts coherently map to the five target entries, with the Blade Runner and The Great Dictator blocks offering the strongest one-to-one scene alignment, followed by Taxi Driver, Whiplash, and Network.",

The accompanying YouTube link in the excerpt provides a concrete citation to an online clip associated with the film, supporting the YouTube_URL field. The second excerpt, while broader, confirms the film's placement within the Before Trilogy and mentions both Before Sunset and its adjacent titles, reinforcing the film title/year context used in the field value even if it does not provide the exact clip details.

Excerpts that provide concrete box office figures and language information directly relate to this verification. Specifically: the excerpt detailing Ikiru presents worldwide box office figures and US/Canada gross, which confirms a non-English (Japanese) film, aligning with automatic underrating by language. The Frances Ha excerpts supply box office numbers (US & worldwide) for a clearly English-language fiction film, which, given the gross size, would tend to fall under the $50 million threshold when inflation-adjusted to 2025 USD. The additional box office-related excerpts for Frances Ha reinforce the pattern of inflow of numeric grosses that could be used to assess underrating under the described methodology. While other excerpts discuss related topics (e.g., general lists or discussions about the film), the most directly relevant evidence consists of explicit gross figures and language cues that feed into the stated criteria for underrating. Putting these together supports the claim that these films could meet the 'underrated' threshold based on their financials and/or non-English status, per the methodology described in the field value.",

Force Majeure's avalanche clip is repeatedly described with a substantial view count, confirming its viral status within European cinema. The excerpts also present explicit numbers (e.g., 2.8M for The Seventh Seal, 1.8M for The Great Beauty rooftop scene, 1.7M for Abre los ojos, 1.3M for Force Majeure clip), which align with the criterion of viral scenes from European films. Additional excerpts discuss Werckmeister Harmonies in a way that aligns with the target of European exchanges but also illustrate a counterpoint: despite attention to European cinema, certain titles did not produce single-scene uploads meeting the 1,000,000-view threshold, which reinforces the qualifier about under-the-radar European works and explicit view thresholds.

These excerpts establish the existence and identification of the scene's film and imply the vicinity of the described moment (the Paris apartment encounter associated with Before Sunset) without asserting or detailing the exact dialogue or actions. In other words, they support the field value by grounding it in the correct film and scene context, which is necessary for accurate cataloging, even though they do not quote the scene's text or verify the precise action of inviting and playing a song.

Specifically, the clip from The Seventh Seal is in a different language and not English-language fiction, but the excerpt that notes a high view count (2,865,094 views) for a scene titled The Seventh Seal YouTube Clip demonstrates the viral-clip phenomenon, offering a data point consistent with the kind of viral scene the field value references, even though the film is not English-language fiction. Other excerpts describe monologues from Paris, Texas and other films, which are examples of insightful scenes from potentially lower-grossing English-language titles, and they provide qualitative context about the nature of these scenes (monologue focus, existential insight). While these do not explicitly confirm the exact named films and grosses cited in the field value, they are thematically aligned as supporting context for a catalog of viral, insightful scenes from lower-profile works.

The excerpts collectively establish (a) that the work is The Great Dictator (a 1940 release) by Charlie Chaplin, a filmmaker of legendary stature; and (b) the related content receives substantial attention on YouTube (e.g., tens of millions of views across the listings and clips). By demonstrating the film's long-standing prominence and large audience reach, these excerpts support the conclusion that the film would fail the 'underrated' fiction criterion as defined. The combination of historic prestige and modern high view counts directly aligns with the reasoning that the film is not underrated by the stated standards.",

The most relevant excerpt directly points to the Whiplash clip and names the key participants (Miles Teller and JK Simmons) and the film, implying a high-tension, confrontational moment in a teaching/assessment context: the clip title references a dynamic of rushing or dragging, which signals pressure and coercive intensity. The second excerpt contributes by providing the video's reach, showing substantial views (indicating viral status), which aligns with the broader criterion that the scene is widely viewed. The third excerpt offers a corroborating production detail (the release year indicated by the date), which helps situate the scene in Whiplash's 2014 timeframe and reinforces the context of the abusive instructor dynamic within the film. Together, these excerpts support the described scene as an intense confrontation framed by manipulation and pressure within a film about pushing for greatness, and they corroborate its viral notoriety and temporal context without revealing additional plot spoilers from outside the referenced clip.",

Excerpt the final speech is explicitly identified as the final speech from The Great Dictator, including the context that it is delivered by the barber, who is mistaken for Adenoid Hynkel, and its purpose as a direct plea for humanity and peace. This directly matches the described scene and its core message. Translations or dubbed editions (as seen in the Spanish source documents) corroborate that the same scene is being presented and discussed in other languages, which reinforces the identity of the scene regardless of language. YouTube video listings referencing The Great Dictator Speech confirm the contemporary popularity and framing of the same scene as a viral, quotable moment. Collectively, these excerpts map onto the described scene: the final, humanist speech in El Gran Dictador that critiques tyranny and advocates for democracy and peace, delivered by the mistaken barber figure. Therefore, the most relevant content centers on the explicit identification of the final speech and its political, humane message, with additional supporting context from translations and video listings that reference the same moment. The reasoning connects the field value to the excerpts by anchoring on (a) explicit labeling of the final speech in the film, (b) the speaker identity and situation, and (c) the thematic core of humanity, democracy, and peace conveyed in that moment.",

The second excerpt confirms the film identity (Whiplash, 2014) via the clip page title and URL, which is important to tie the discussion to the same film referenced in the field value. The third excerpt provides a date (May 20, 2014), which helps situate the clip chronologically but does not directly speak to awards, box-office, or critical acclaim. Taken together, the available excerpts offer partial support for the notion that this particular clip did not demonstrate viral reach, which is relevant to evaluating the underrating criterion, but they do not provide explicit information about Academy Awards or worldwide gross, so they cannot fully substantiate the film's high-profile status from the excerpts alone.",

Some excerpts describe the clip in a way that underscores its lasting memorability, indirectly supporting the notion that the film's influence outweighs any modest initial box office. Finally, an excerpt describing the scene and its clip format helps establish the ongoing popularity and reach of Blade Runner content, contributing to the understanding that the film's impact persists beyond its original release.
