  "input": "Of course. Here is a prompt designed to curate a database of insightful mathematical visuals, perfect for anyone looking to understand math in a more intuitive, graphical way.\n\nInsightful Mathematical Visuals Database Prompt\nResearch Briefing & Objective:\n\nYou are a Lead Curriculum Designer for an innovative online learning platform focused on STEM education. Your mission is to build a visual encyclopedia of mathematics by curating images, GIFs, and diagrams that teach mathematical concepts intuitively. This database will serve as the core asset for creating engaging course materials, articles, and educational content.\n\nPhase 1: Search & Selection Criteria\n\nYour goal is to find high-quality visuals that offer an \"aha!\" moment in understanding a mathematical idea. Each visual must meet the following criteria:\n\nInstructive & Clear: The image or animation must clearly illustrate a specific mathematical theorem, concept, or relationship. The visual itself should do most of the teaching.\n\nVisually Engaging: The visual should be clean, well-designed, and aesthetically pleasing. It should draw the viewer in and make them curious.\n\nSourced & Reputable: The visual should originate from a credible source, such as an educational website, a university page, a reputable mathematics blog, an academic paper, or a high-quality educational video.\n\nPhase 2: Dataset Compilation & Final Deliverable\n\nThe final output must be a comprehensive table in CSV format, with each row representing a single, unique mathematical visual.\n\nThe table must have the following exact headers:\n\nVisual_URL (A direct link to the image or GIF file)\n\nConcept_Illustrated\n\nVisual_Technique\n\nTarget_Audience\n\nWhy_It_Works\n\nSource_Type\n\nSource_URL (The URL of the article, page, or video where the visual was found)\n\nConstraint Checklist:\nConcept_Illustrated: Name the primary mathematical idea being shown. Be specific (e.g., \"Visualizing Pi,\" \"The Pythagorean Theorem Proof,\" \"Golden Ratio in Nature,\" \"Fourier Transform Decomposition,\" \"Pascal's Triangle and Fractals\").\n\nVisual_Technique: Classify the method used to convey the information. Use standardized terms like: Geometric Proof, Animated GIF, Data Visualization, Interactive Diagram, Fractal Art, Real-World Analogy.\n\nTarget_Audience: Estimate the intended learning level for the visual. Use categories like: Elementary School, Middle School, High School, Undergraduate, General Audience.\n\nWhy_It_Works: Provide a concise, one-sentence explanation of what makes the visual so effective (e.g., \"It connects an abstract formula to a simple, tangible physical action.\").\n\nSource_Type: Categorize the source as Educational Blog, Academic Paper, University Website, Explainer Video, or Online Encyclopedia.\n\nExclusions: Avoid purely decorative mathematical art that doesn't teach a concept. Do not include static textbook pages or dense, unannotated graphs. The key is intuitive understanding at a glance.",
