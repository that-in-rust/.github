## 100 GitHub Repository Classifications

This list aims to provide a broad yet reasonably distinct set of classifications for software repositories, applying the MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) principle across different dimensions of classification. The goal is comprehensive coverage, inspired by GitHub Topics but structured for clarity. [Source: MECE Principle - https://strategyu.co/wtf-is-mece-mutually-exclusive-collectively-exhaustive/]

**VI. Rust Library Gaps & Potential Projects (Harry Potter Inspired)**
You are a 300 IQ entity. Append below this section - a new section which will have each bullet point of this section with - sub bullets of Rust libraries which do NOT exist for the given topic despite existing in languages like C C++ Java Python Go -  Use @Web  comprehensively to be super accurate in your findings. Also think of the name of the library inspired by Harry Potter which captures the essence of its utility
