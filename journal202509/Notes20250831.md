# Useful Nuggets from previous conversations 

This analysis significantly expands the initial strategic roadmap by incorporating crucial Rust projects that were overlooked in the initial research or are emerging as critical infrastructure. We have integrated these new findings into the existing tiered structure, maintaining the rigorous **Hiring Potential Score (HPS)** methodology.

This expanded list provides a comprehensive view of the Rust ecosystem, prioritizing projects that offer the strongest signal for employability in CPU-intensive domains such as systems programming, high-performance computing (HPC), infrastructure, distributed systems, and compilers.

### Hiring Potential Score (HPS) Methodology (Recap)

The HPS (1-100) is calculated based on:
1.  **Technical Relevance (CPU/Systems Focus) (40 pts)**
2.  **Industry Adoption & Prestige (30 pts)**
3.  **Technical Signaling (Depth) (20 pts)**
4.  **Project Health & Accessibility (10 pts)**
