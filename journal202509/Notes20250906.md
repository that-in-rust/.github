Deconstructing a langauge in layers 
- Language features independent of OS - L1
    - no-std in rust
- standard libraries of the language - L2 is written with the help of L1
- external libraries of the language - L3 is written with help of only L1 or L1+L2
    - tokio in Rust, Axum framework
- now people start using the language
    - they will find useful-logic-templates for L1, L2, L3 which are basically called idiomatic patterns of the language
        - important to note - L1-idiomatic is different from L2-idiomatic is different from L3-idiomatic
        - these 3 idiomatic collections are 20% of the langauge which can be enough to write
            - 99% code
            - with highest efficiency
            - with lowest bugs
            - with easiest readability
