## Exploring a programming language in layers
``` text 
Deconstructing a langauge in layers 
- Language features independent of OS - L1
    - no-std in rust
- standard libraries of the language - L2 is written with the help of L1
- external libraries of the language - L3 is written with help of only L1 or L1+L2
    - tokio in Rust, Axum framework
- now people start using the language
    - they will find useful-logic-templates for L1, L2, L3 which are basically called idiomatic patterns of the language
        - important to note
            - L1-idiomatic is different from L2-idiomatic is different from L3-idiomatic
            - idiomatic patterns are not thought of when the language features are released, they are discovered as an emergent property of the use the language itself, because a langauge is so complicated that all the permuations of combinations of using it cannot be predicted in advance
        - these 3 idiomatic collections are 20% of the langauge which can be enough to write
            - 99% code
            - with lowest bugs
            - with highest efficiency (memory usage, time usage)
            - with easiest readability (long term maintainability)
- At least in Rust idiomatic-low-bug code means the code which compiles in minimum attempts
    - This might not be the most efficient code and might not be the most readable code
    - This is different from other langauges because they can have runtime errors which can be caught at compile time in Rust
