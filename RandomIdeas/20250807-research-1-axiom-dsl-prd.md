## **Product Requirements Document: Axiom v1.0**

- **Version:** 1.0
- **Status:** In Development
- **Last Updated:** August 7, 2025
- **Author:** [Your Name/Team]

### **1. Overview**

**Axiom** is a next-generation Domain-Specific Language (DSL) and toolchain for building web user interfaces. Its purpose is to radically simplify web development by eliminating an entire class of state management errors.

It solves the problem of unpredictable and complex state interactions in large applications. Instead of developers writing imperative code to manually manipulate the UI, they declaratively define the application's logic as a set of **facts** and **rules**. The Axiom compiler then acts as a theorem prover, verifying the logic's correctness at compile time and producing a highly optimized, high-performance WebAssembly (Wasm) runtime.

The result is a development process that shifts bug-finding from runtime testing to the compile stage, leading to more robust, maintainable, and performant web applications.

### **2. Goals and Objectives**

| Goal                     | Objective                                                       | Success Metric                                                                                                       |
| :----------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Performance**          | Deliver a runtime faster than major declarative UI frameworks.  | Achieve >15% better Lighthouse scores (Performance, TBT) on benchmark apps compared to equivalent React/Svelte apps. |
| **Robustness**           | Eradicate "impossible state" runtime errors.                    | Achieve zero state-related runtime errors in a suite of complex test applications.                                   |
| **Bundle Size**          | Keep the core runtime lean and efficient.                       | The gzipped size of the minimal Axiom runtime (Wasm + JS glue) must be under **25kB**.                               |
| **Developer Adoption**   | Foster a growing community of early adopters.                   | Reach **10,000** monthly active users of the VS Code extension within 12 months of the v1.0 launch.                  |
| **Developer Experience** | Make logic programming intuitive and debugging straightforward. | Achieve a >80% satisfaction score on developer surveys regarding tooling and error messages.                         |

### **4. Functional Requirements**

#### **4.1. DSL (Axiom Language)**

- Users must be able to define strongly-typed `schema` for facts and components.
- Users must be able to declare immutable `facts` that represent the application's state.
- Users must be able to write `rules` (`head :- body.`) to derive new information and UI components from facts.
- The language must support a `component` primitive for defining reusable UI structures.
- The language must include a `command` primitive to declaratively manage side effects (e.g., HTTP requests).
- The language must provide a syntax for conditional styling (e.g., applying a CSS class based on a fact).

#### **4.2. Compiler (`axc`)**

- The compiler must parse `.ax` files and generate a corresponding Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
- It must perform type checking against the defined `schema`.
- It must perform logical validation to detect contradictions or unsatisfiable rules, producing human-readable errors.
- It must compile a valid AST into an optimized **WebAssembly (Wasm) module** and a minimal **JavaScript glue** file.
- The compiler must be available as a standalone CLI tool and as a plugin for major bundlers (Vite, Webpack).

#### **4.3. Runtime**

- The JS glue must load the Wasm module and bootstrap the application.
- The runtime must efficiently manage the fact database within Wasm memory.
- It must provide a simple API for JS to assert new facts (e.g., from user events).
- It must execute `commands` defined in the Axiom code and feed their results back into the system as new facts.
- The Wasm engine, upon a change in facts, must produce a minimal "patch list" of DOM changes and pass it to the JS glue for application.

#### **4.4. Tooling (LSP & Debugger)**

- A Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation must provide auto-completion, syntax highlighting, and diagnostics in modern code editors.
- A **Visual Debugger** extension for VS Code must allow users to inspect the current database of facts in real-time.
- The debugger must allow users to click on a UI element and see the full "inference chain" (the rules and facts) that caused it to render.

### **5. Technical Requirements**

- **System Architecture:** The compiler and core logic engine will be built in **Rust** for performance and safety. The target output is **WebAssembly (Wasm)** for the runtime logic and **JavaScript (ESM)** for the DOM interaction layer.
- **Performance Requirements:**
  - **Latency:** DOM updates resulting from a fact change must complete in under **16ms** on an average user device.
  - **Throughput:** The runtime must handle bursts of up to 100 fact updates per second without freezing the UI thread (leveraging internal debouncing).
- **Scalability Needs:** The logic engine must scale to handle applications with up to **100,000 facts** and **5,000 rules**, with initial "solve" times under 1 second.
- **Security & Compliance:**
  - All data passed from the runtime to the DOM must be sanitized to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. The JS glue must avoid `innerHTML` and `eval()`.
  - The project will be licensed under the **MIT License**.
  - As a development tool, Axiom itself is not subject to GDPR, but documentation will provide guidance on building compliant applications.

### **6. Non-Functional Requirements**

- **Usability:** Compiler errors and warnings must be actionable and link directly to the source code.
- **Accessibility (A11y):** The documentation and example projects must adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA standards. The language itself must enable, not hinder, the creation of accessible components.
- **Reliability:** The compiler must be deterministic (same input always produces the same output). The runtime must be memory-safe and leak-free. Target a 99.9% uptime for all associated services (e.g., documentation website).
- **Maintainability:** The Rust and TypeScript codebases must maintain a test coverage of over 90% and adhere to strict linting rules and code formatting standards.

---

### **7. Assumptions and Constraints**

- **Assumptions:**
  - Target users have proficiency in modern web development fundamentals (HTML, CSS, JS, CLI).
  - There is a market appetite for a paradigm shift to solve state management pain points.
- **Constraints:**
  - The core development team is capped at [e.g., 6 engineers, 1 product manager, 1 designer].
  - The v1.0 release is targeted for a timeline of 18-20 months.
  - The project budget is [e.g., $X million].
