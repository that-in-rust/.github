# What is a DSL?

A **DSL** (Domain-Specific Language) is a computer language specialized to a particular application domain. Unlike general-purpose programming languages (such as Python, Java, or Rust), which are designed for a wide range of tasks, a DSL is crafted to be highly effective at expressing solutions within a specific area or for a particular kind of problem.

## Key Points about DSLs

- **Domain-Specific**: Tailored for a particular problem space (e.g., web page layout, database queries, build automation).
- **Concise and Expressive**: Allows users to write less code to express complex ideas in the target domain.
- **Easier for Domain Experts**: Often designed so that people who are experts in the domain (but not necessarily in programming) can use them effectively.

## Examples of DSLs

| DSL Example         | Domain/Use Case                                 |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| SQL                 | Querying and manipulating databases             |
| HTML/CSS            | Describing the structure and style of web pages |
| Regular Expressions | Pattern matching in text                        |
| Makefiles           | Build automation                                |
| Graphviz DOT        | Describing graphs                               |

## Types of DSLs

- **External DSLs**: Have their own syntax and are parsed separately (e.g., SQL, HTML).
- **Internal/Embedded DSLs**: Built within a general-purpose language using its syntax and features (e.g., RSpec
